Round 1
NESS LEE
Take over, the break's over, wigger

God emcee, lee, straight yola

No shake no baking soda dispose of ya lame doja

I can't wait to light up this square nigga chain smoker

So this the new dude they pushing trying to get him views

I'll get him chewed with one bar in a round, letter Q

You let him loose to let him lose, think he's on my level

You're the 40 Year Old Virgin, you're putting this pussy on a pedestal

You're getting screwed if I shoot...sex pistol

You better have arms coming out of arms, yep, Vishnu

That's a Hindu reference but I'll get back to that

Let's return to the surface of this soul book I've read into

Your name is Jed Mitchell, know what rhymes with Jed Mitchell

Ness hit you, neck issues

Tecs, pistols, kick you in your leg, trip you

Dead, crippled, nigga you have the swagger of wet tissue

Let's be honest... You a awkward white nigga b

With these little depressed gothic-like tendencies

He's Walter White in his schemes, but real life

He walks by I wanna stomp some life into him till my conscious side intervenes

True or false, Blackout 3 the second time Drake came

All the rappers got to Toronto the same day

Met in front of the telly we took pictures and exchanged names

I leave to go to my room and see you in a strange place

Tucked away safe in the lobby with this ashamed face

I say hey, shake hands wave and say g'day mate

I slept a few hours woke up at 8:00, I shaved, ate

Made my way back downstairs and you was still in the same place

Me and my nigga Harsh had coerced some girls to come get us

Diz already had some birds with him set up

Everybody had a flame from dimes to sloppy in between

But if you pulled anything you shoulda learned to stretch better

Boy I'm absurd with every word I get better

With every verb I'm trying to curb my furthest personal measure

And you never heard a more clever verse from a bird of my feather

So yeah I was irked I couldn't remember my words against Sevah

That just means I gotta take it out on this nerd bird

He gone learn or earn him an urn or permanent stretcher

Shoot'em a curve he'll serve as the catcher

When I Toledo panic button him and we ain't even working together

SOUL
I'm just gonna keep it real, to me you're one of the dopest rappers that made it through

Wordplay and cadence too... it's nothing but love... I can only say what's true

But what the fuck were you thinking when you said you're "crazier than crazy glue"

Oh... ain't that you?

Oh Ness Lee... Then forget the first 2 bars... he's wack and I hate this dude

Dopest in the south you ain't that fuckin' hard mate

And no way you're Elliot Ness, cause in his career, he managed to catch up to Scarface

Think about it… dopest in the south… not on my watch

I was on Limewire in '08 freestylin to "My Block"

Plus Young Jeezy, Kriss Kross, Andre, T.I, Jon

You need to revisit your status like Timehop

And those are just some names that are colder from the A

Fuck the dopest in the south, you ain't the dopest in your state

It's a white lie, a myth, how's my guy the king

When his tracks get sonned by CyHi The Prynce

Other people carry your state, the truth's out liar

I ring bells I'm the new town crier

Your state's like his new house when you blew out your cookout fryer

Cause you both rely on other people to put out fire

Fucking crawling on the floor tryna escape through the catflap

Scared to breathe around the air he in (Aryan) like Anne Frank

Rep faded, that's that, get traded, Nasdaq

So much heat in the pad, he having flashbacks

Scratch that, insurance scam man had the last laugh

Now it's hand bags, glad rags, flash jags, cracked crab

Gabbana man bags, Tax bracket half capped

He survived the fire, we saw through it like Mad Max

Fucking piece of shit, scamming rap music, for p's and shit

But he got Karma in the form of a scheming bitch that cheats on him

Now that ain't something she'll admit, but how do you not see the hints

It plays "how could you be so heartless" when her beeper rings

On Fridays, it's night babe, kiss him on the cheek and dip

She out all night fucking Heartless and swinging from Conceited's dick

I blame The Saurus, she ain't beat him since Peter did

He ain't seen the chick he sleeping since that Grecian myth like Oedipus

Round 2
NESS LEE
I said I'll smack your dumb ass

Your girl shorter than Sonny

If I was a pedophile I'd snatch her young ass

This weirdo pretty much admitted that Loe Pesci created his style

That'd be great if I hadn't already made him my child

So if I kilt the guy that made you this may take you a while

But give me one good reason you shouldn't have stayed in the crowd

You prolly got a Bender tatt on your back

Come on you can admit it plus the fact that you rap

Cxactly like him, and your girl lives in Canada, Facts

Y'all probably met on a Flight Distance battle rap chat

Back when I's packin a mac in the back of the lac

You was swagger jacking Patrick from his slacks to his hat

You and Osa battled you barely came at him in fact

He coulda stabbed your grandma you'd hand him the handle for that

No matter where you're at you land on they're sack asking for

Pats on the back as if that can grant you the talent to actually rap

I'll backgammon backhand him till he admit to snatching

The patterns they spat after the fact you talentless twat

Remember when I was gonna beat up Loe Pesci for being so messy

That shit played on his dome heavy

He all in his room like "I gotta get this Ness guy murdered"

Drinking, taking tablets like dishonest Best Buy workers

He wrote in his diary in broken english in cursive

All caps screaming n' cursing like I just wanna beat him and hurt him

Take my knee and insert it knee deep in his sternum

Then I seen him in person and didn't think it was worth it

Ya little awkward ass, dog you rap and that is how awkward sounds

You live in an awkward house without living in Okwerdz' house

You wanted to kill me that's like walking in Bonnie's house

Seeing her on the couch with lots of money... It's the thought (thot) that counts

You too cold for who, fool, do you know

I do own Lucifer's shoes to move through the snow

And who got your dude losing to Soul?

I'm looking at you sideways like, I was waiting on you from the doe

Let's get it clear boy we are not peers boy

I see the future you getting destroyed here boy

I'm clairvoyant there's no avoiding you hear boy

And I feel like roasting bring dat ass hear boy

You ol "I wallow in sorrow" face ass nigga

You ol "you got a trench coat I can borrow" face ass nigga

You ol, "I got a lotta homework I'ma do it tonight

Then go and shoot up the school tomorrow" face ass nigga

SOUL
This the last market where there's people you think I can't compete with

Well you'll be some of the last two I follow Fibonacci's sequence

They think Ness'll crush me, but this my bread and butter

Plus they thought you'd crush Swave, but you got head topped brother

You see - Ness got flustered, over what Jed's got covered

Down to a science, in cruise control like L Ron Hubbard

Plus every time you battle a black dude, your bars get thug

Like you mixing down and pitching out the cartel's drugs

But all that time not walking made his arms swell up

So if he working out the traps, that's a barbell shrug

Bro you are well loved, you know who you are, so rep it

Be like your broke legs, bone tendons, don't stretch it

Say the Steeler ram in their dome, I'll put money he won't, dead it

He'll take half back, so i'll match that… whatever Jerome Bet is (Jerome Bettis)

Soul Pettis, you a bantamweight with one bangin' tape like Caraway,

He the man in state? I'll Axe the A, Atlanta braves batting cage

That money was sound, I sculpted these rounds, that cash is clay (Cassius Clay)

....And this shit would make Mohammad change back his name

I'm back to old fashioned ways, give a fuck if what I'm rapping they catch today

Think him being black clouds that vision?

What I drop, burn him over the head like acid rain

You masquerade, Bruce Jenner cause you felt you had to change

Just cause other man would say that they raised ratchet K's

You went from RCA to getting smashed by Swave, how the fuck does that feel

You went from R Kelly, Parton, Presley, Usher and Seal

To Tony D's lone defeat when he struggled with Real

Cause they can't get in touch with T-Pain, since he fucked up his deal

And it probably didn't do much for your rep with RCA

When they found a bunch of beats made by T-Pain on Ebay

And the jokes thing is you probably helped all those guys

Cause you make incredible beats, and you get bread on the side

And that's Ness' career cause if he tells them he rhymes

He'll be sitting on the shelf till he dies

They say you're ahead of your time, so you wont get any shine

But that's enough about his career, and the dent in his pride

Cause I could spend three minutes on what one sentence describes

Always the Bridesmaid, never the bride

Round 3
NESS LEE
I said well it's the third round, it's the part where I gotta move you

You keep mentioning T-Pain, it's unfortunate I gotta let that auto tune you nigga

I told you four years ago we would probably battle, now we're finally meeting

And Eurgh gets the finder's fee for this minor league beating

But you climbed no higher than me, why? For these reasons

You might just be peeking (peaking) like hide and seek cheating

I said your time is over, no need to fight it b, I'll find your v

And end your life with two 9's fused together that's Siamese treatment

Your wifey acting like a speed demon

You gone come home early one night and find that she's creeping

He told me his shorty was acting like a whore again

So I told him get over hurr like Aye Verb quoting Scorpion

I convinced him to leave her, texted her that I work from four to ten

She came to my job at 8:00, slutty exes for the win

Now he staring at me like he wanna do something,

I'm feeling fairly scrappy what you tryna do cuzzin?

I'm with it sir you better get the burner

Cause as far as hands, I'm down to throw them over stairs/stares like attempted murder

I'm known to let 'em fly like the old Kobe

When I throw a right you're likely to find your soul floating

If we box I'll beat you till your skin turns black and blue

They gone be online debating whether you white or gold homie

I know, ye'en tryina get buried I feel ya

But you'll pay with your life don't worry I'll bill ya

And clean it up first things first if I kill ya

I cover all bases like a dirty outfielder

I'm nauseous, you made me face this sucker suck a sausage

You're unaccomplished find a draw bridge try jumping off it

And what is all this other nonsense about you punching Caustic?

...Dog that's fucking awesome I should give you a couple dollars

But I digress, I'll take your rib, you'll never get your baby back

You're really not an emcee, you only faking that

And you really want to prove me wrong so I raise the tax

Show me you can do it like this, now I'ma make you rap

Fourth quarters are preferred it's less pressure

I'm the perfect defender for the tournament ender

Ye'en heard the word I'm the desert bird on the dresser

I'm certainly worse than Serbian weather the first of December

And it has been determined forever that I will be determined forever

To rid the earth of every nerd in suspenders

Then I'm murdering Bender, return to his funeral service

Do the bird is the word, the Shmurda dance and merge em together, ya heard

Ayo Bender, I been calling you out for years, where you been at?

Next time you call me out in a battle, make sure you win that

SOUL
Lee endgames's a free checkmate

Cause his set ups all over the place, he's playing chess with DNA

So tonight, will B3 L's... like he's playing chess with DNA

When he bish up next to a rook... like he playing chess with DNA

See a pawn's what you be to (B2) these dudes, so that's where he moved

But they opened up the D 2, so the queen took a free rook

Put it simply, he's been used, so call me Aryan, but these views

Is deep blue, a machine too, he lose in three moves

Idun Beechu? Beat who? Give a beat to me you couldn't beat Tumi too?

See dude's schemes drew, weave through and it leaves smooth

So it seems cool but the ease you, do what he do and appeal to

The cheap ooh's, deceitful

Need proof? It must be true if I can beat dude and teach you

What Lee do with the same style that he use

It's simple as shit, you stick to the script like a read-through

Think I'm sick of this bit? I'm sticking with it, that's a preview

I'll breeze through, Bones Jones, go Ham'll defeat you

Fuck the towel that your team threw, if we lose it's a DQ

Get dough, Jeet Kun, we Bruce Lee's crew

Wake up from the dream too when I teeps you with Kareem's foot

This the game of death, bruv I had to fight my way up the tiers too

Now the Scot's (Scott) going beast mode like Teen Wolf

But after KOTD flew this Lee dude to the beach to

Not get past C3P0, like R2D2 in a green room

Pussy, this battle rap shit's something you bleed through

Nah you camel toe, seen his V through his jeans too like Evisu

It's a game boy, made it past an elite few, now you beat blue

For that money, I read, black for the green too like a healed bruise

This is Soul Volume 2, that's equal, to Lee cubed

This the PC he use to make beats through

When it crash, and then reboot, but the screen blue

And the CPU freeze too, cause this safe mode to what I'll command c: through

Ryu and T-2000 I'm heatproof

He's proof, heat could decease you, cause he breathed fumes

When the gas leak blew on a cheap fuse, that he keeps loose

Left his knee chewed, thats the only time he walked with the steel too

My point it this, it's ironic bitch, that the pain for this recruit

Was when he leaped to the same window that T threw his career through
