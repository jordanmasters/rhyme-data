Just gonna let this build up real quick
Alright here we go
Omegle bars you know what it is
Alright, look, uh, look, uh, look, uh
I'm 'bout to strike ya
When I rock they all gettin' hyper
I'm known for gettin' busy when I'm all in the cypher
Yeah and you know that I come with that hype sound
We in the cypher right now passin' the mic 'round
Uh, we kicking bars and we trading fours
I be wondering, 'yo what the fuck they hating for?'
We 'bout to break it down forever, bullshit we rise above
We be all up in the freestyle cypher, we sharing the love
Let's go, I'ma do this for the art
I do not read from the script and I do not play a part
Every bar is from my heart
We be in the cypher boosting positivity
We getting mad creative and we taking hella liberties
Put words together so exquisitely
I defy the laws of physicality
Can't nobody challenge me
I'm restoring balance G
And you know that I rap fat
Peace out to my man 'cause we both turned our hats back
Yeah, I'm right here and I'm free and strong
I connect from L.A. out to Vietnam, c'mon
I'm here to rock ya, my lyrics will shock ya
He's spent all day playing football, I mean soccer
Either way you say it Harry Mack about to lay it
Man, the style that I'm using it is not the one to play with
And skills like this online what you never see
I'm getting fame but keeping my integrity
'Cause I won't let this corny ass game rearrange me
Won't let this hip-hop industry change me
I won't let anybody tell me how to act
I'ma be myself everytime I kick a rap
Peace to Kendrick, Peace to J. Cole
Peace to the ones who really stay soul illmatic when they faithful
To the way they living and they flow is unforgiving
Told you when I'm spitting I'ma break you out the mental prison
Let's get it, yeah
Mack all up on it, got what you need
I bring fire, can't deny I get you higher than weed
Yeah I'm lasting long when I'm spitting I'm strong
I get you high like the kron that you packed in your bong
Uh, nothing subtle when I bubble kinda like the chamber
Yeah we smoking weed then releasing all the anger
Uh, we don't need to feel that way right now
We 'bout to breathe out negativity with this smoke cloud
I put it down
Yeah, your vibe, I go beyond it
Whats that I'm crumbling inside my joint paper? Its kronic
Yeah, I'm so sick I vomit when I'm in the mix
Peace to all the fans who be listening to this
Yeah, and y'all know that I come through with more raps
I pour that so shouts out to my homie in the orange hat
Yeah, you know I'm dripping lyrics out my mouth
Los Angeles and Vietnam up in the house

[[B]]
I get it started, ain't no stopping me
They be coppin' my styles like a shopping spree
C'mon, I do it much better than ever before
They be shopping for lyrics, they bought their style at the store
Uh, but I'm beyond that, I be rockin' nonstop
Rappers sound like they cop their style at a pawn shop
Secondhand but me, I be the clever man
Uh, I come off the top and I forever slam
I do it like this, and y'all know its insane man
They be shopping for my merch, it's the name brand
I'm 'bout to lift it up to show y'all on the screen
Harry Mack I'm really out here, I'ma split a rapper's spleen
Let's go, uh, I'm 'bout to do it in a new way
Speakin' of shopping he be coppin' FCUK
I see it on your t-shirt right now, I call it out
Kickin' rhymes off the top, thats what I'm always about
Now listen, let me break it down, y'all know that Mack is winning
Got they heads spinnin', I go deep with rhythm like I'm swimming
Yeah, I take y'all to school, I'm breakin the rules
I feel like Michael Phelps everytime I jump in the pool
C'mon, this hip-hop lyricism game, I be winning that
I get the gold medal like Michael Phelps when swimming laps
I'm going back and forth, y'all know they impressed
Spittin' 'til I'm out of breath
And like a pool I've got the depth!
C'mon, yeah when I'm arriving I be supplying
The lyrics that got your eyes bulging like I'm deep sea diving
Going deep in this, y'all know I got the bars they couldn't measure
I be swimming so deep I be feelin' hella pressure
Yeah, hey yo, right now I'm about to set your year off
Go so deep when swimming I might even feel my ears pop
Uh, and I should probably be fearful
Deep sea diving, now its blood out my ear hole
Uh, I be comin' real fresh when I be rippin' this
Ayo, y'all know that I'm 'bout to scale tip in this
Rhythmic shit that I spit
Y'all know I never quit
Harry Mack you know I be the cleverest
Now when it be comin' the lyrics off top of the brain
You know that I'm locked in
Hoppin' all up in the ring and now I'm boxing
Even from a distance I know that they saw me
I swing in the ring like my name Muhammad Ali
Yeah my lyrics never borin' when I'm scorchin'
Matter of fact I grill rappers like I'm George Foreman
Uh, and you know I get lots of love
I go bare fists homie, no boxing gloves
Yeah, uh, yo with the art I spark
I said it's MMA, that's the mixed martial arts
I'm goin' in, yeah, and if you test me
I'll hop up in the boxing ring like it was UFC
I'm goin' off, I'm never soft, when I be spittin' it I do work
He got the gray hoodie and his homie got the blue shirt
Yeah, they love how I control with the rhymes
They in the UK and I can see they pulling the blinds
Yeah, they never expected I would spit off the head
I got their jaws dropping, these homies just sit on the bed
They steady watching, best use caution
When I'm on it I'ma smash it
Peace my dude watching, he be rockin' the glasses
Yeah and you know that I'm 'bout to press a threat
Funny how y'all both sharing one headset
But I hope you both hear these lyrics up in your ear
Gotta be the greatest freestyle y'all heard all 

[[C]]
They wanna use my style, can’t afford it
Uh, your whole entire flavor been imported
Uh, y’all know that my lyrics are gigantic
My vibe been imported from a whole 'nother planet
I'm ill, I said I’m shining like the stars
I am not from Earth, I’m imported here from Mars
Yeah, yo, he’s getting high right now, he got the munchies
Imported like it came from different country
I’m on another plane, doing more lyrics right off the brain
Uh, first he rolled up the blunt, then he hit the tip of that with the flame
I come off of the tip, when I spit like this they gon’ understand
When it be coming to lyrics yo, all of these rappers got underhand
Come again, let me think
I’m about to push ‘em right to the brink
When it comes to lyrics I'ma make y'all sing
Harry Mack, you know that I do it like that
I be spewing quite fat and I’m on another level
You know I'ma kill it for certain
All of these rappers they watch from a distance, I guess all these haters are lurkin’
Yeah, you know I say what I say, I grab it, I'm ready to snap
They be lurking like they watching on Twitch but not saying shit in my chat
Uh, I’m about to break it down cause I be the number one performer
Tried to warn ya, uh, rappers they be creepin, lurkin’ in the corner
Coming around, tryna see me, make it look easy
I’ll be off the top with the motherfucking freestee
Uh, lyrics you know I got plenty
Shoutout to the homie @blackshepherd420
Uh, you know I gotta go follow
Uh, all of these rappers is hollow
Uh, you know I blast off the planet, uh, I feel it just like Apollo
Uh, and I spit through the static, I react out of habit
When it be coming to lyrics y’all know that my brain fully automatic
Woo! I do what I feel all of my lyrics be sounding too real
When it comes to bars from the top of the dome
People know that I got the appeal
C'mon, I break it down and I flow off the brain
These rappers got me crossed like what you got on your chain
Yeah, I try to tell you man, I stay in the zone
Got the earbud in, he said, “I’m on the phone”
Uh, ayo, honestly that shit was mad scary
Especially when you asked me if my name was Harry
I’m like, "Hold up wait a minute, uh, by all indications
It seems to me like you be hacking all my information"
Let’s go! Uh, I get down kick it like a roundhouse
He be trippin’ so he’s lifted his fist right up to his mouth
C'mon, I'ma make 'em understand
Grip on the mic and I’m ready to slam
Kinda like that thing you got on the side, I be spittin’ for all my fans
Get it, I spit it, y'all know I do it, lastin' long
Right behind your head I see you got the glass bong
No one goes beyond me G
Plus you got the black cap with the kronic leaves
Hey, ayo, I be out here spreading more love
Like the earrings you be rocking Harry Mack is the plug
Let's go, I'ma tip and y’all know how I spit
I try to tell him if I freestyle this shit is legit

[[D]]
Yeah, never no poser
To the greatest, I'm coming much closer
When I rap they relax like on a sofa
Lyrics out my mouth, y'all know what I'm about
Stay on my route, I be pushin' like the cushions on couch
H Mack I put it down, y'all know how I do
Uh, rappers soft like a couch cushion, its true
But not me, 'cause you know I'm 'bout to burn it up
From the brain I rearrange like your furniture
Uh, yeah, pay attention to the words my tongue say
Moving the sofa, I'm increasing my feng shui
Mack all up in it, I be getting loose
Like the OJ in your glass, all these rappers gettin' juiced
Check how I perform, I really tried to warn
I treat a rappers whole brain kinda like a orange
Then I turn 'em into OJ
Before I rapped they looked at me, and they thought no way
Now they see I'm okay
I'm about to put it down, I'm too hard, out of sight
Like your PJs, I shine through the starry night
Coming off the tip with this when I release this
And similar to your hoodie, I earn stripes like Adidas
Yeah, I break it down for all of y'all, my lyrics seem fly
On top of her cup there be a little green guy
I be coming off the tip with this believe me
The lyrics I'm providing, man I make this shit sound easy
Let's go, I come off the top, never be stoppin' ya know that i'm rockin' on
Uh, never gon' stop, even in front of a red octagon
Yeah, y'all know I'm increasing the great vibes
Octagon, thats a shape, but one that has 8 sides
Uh, I break it down man, y'all know they some wannabes
Rappers gettin' bent outta shape, no geometry
Y'all had better honor me
8 sides to my individual steelo
I break 'em down 'cause he goes
Freestyle is the first side
And the second side to my mind is the lyrics that I write
The third side of me is the one that feels compassion
The fourth side is the one focused on rap smashin'!
Fifth side of me is the one that stays indoors
The one that doesn't wanna be with people anymore
But yo, the sixth side of my personality
Is the one that goes out to party, and can't nobody challenge me
Yeah the seventh side, the one that loves my family
The eighth side, the one that hates rappers tryna damage me
So basically while I'm out here rockin' songs
I proved to y'all that my brain is the octagon
