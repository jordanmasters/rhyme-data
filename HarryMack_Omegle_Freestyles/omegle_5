Yo what the fuck was your assumption
I'mma get the whole shit jumpin'
The people going crazy when I'm live at the function
Yeah, these rappers make me wonder though
The way they spit their lyrics sounding dysfunctional
Uh, I told you Mack coming back
I take the first syllable I can't funk with that
Hold up, he's surprised by how hard I went
The first syllable again, funk like parliament
I'm talking funkadelic, these rappers old like a relic
Uh, I got one story now I'm ready to tell it
Got his face going crazy from the rhymes that I'm kicking
Dog, honestly I'm impressed by the words you was picking
I ain't going to the function, unless we can get my boys in
Bouncers trying to kick me out dog, that's straight poison
Damn y'all know that I'm really bout to master this
Said I'm poisonous, like materials that's hazardous
Uh, ayo you know I'm funky like some old socks
Yeah, hazardous like you were sipping clorox
Damn, ayo it's hard for me to focus
The president said "Clorox will cure us from the covid"
What the fuck is that? there's no way that it's real
When I'm spitting off the top I'm about to get the appeal
Yeah, ayo I'm ready to snap, it's Harry Mack
The freestyle cat, poison like you lay for the rats
C'mon, I put it down for my people y'all know we out here
I'm about to let em know what we all about here
Ayo the way I kick my bars is absurd
My man do me a favor remind me of the third word
**Purified**
That's right, that's right, oh for certain guy
You know my words are fly
These lyrics that I kick off top are hella purified
My name is certified, I crack the surface, I
Really go deep in this, they be repeating this
I told you I'm out here just living my dream
These rappers unpurified like water out of the stream
I said I be living like a king, I stay on some raw shit
Take the water from the stream in a pot then I boil it
Now it's purified, I get rid of the toxins
I get rid of the poison, I be steadily rocking
I got all of these rappers straight up dropping in coffins
I'm an impossible problem, I just do this too often
Dude I'm too awesome, y'all know that I spit like none other
And like what's hanging on your wall I got incredible colors
Yeah, ayo I still flowing cause I'm not dead yet
I be in the red yep, he be rocking headset
Harry Mack up in it with the deadly sting
I said do you like hip-hop? He said "everything"
All good when I'm on it, yo peace out to my manager
I'm bout to rock a show for my homie up in Canada
Going to Quebec to catch wreck, so what did y'all expect
Uh, like poison I'm about to infect
C'mon, I'm getting busy every time I create

Uh, Mack, in effect, I'll be rockin' the tunes
Uh, kinda like a wolf, I'ma howl at the moon
Yeah, I never hesitate, I'm here to spit raw
I'm movin' like some wolves, rollin' with them big dogs
Yeah, comin' off the tip, we get the room smoky
I'm movin' like the wolves, or like them damn coyotes
I'm really in it and I'm 'bout to rise above
When push comes to shove, I be spreadin' more love
Uh, I make the shit look easy, I be so sick I'm queasy
I'm here to spread the positivity, the L-O-V-E
Yeah, I'm out here just reppin' the art
Ayo, I spit it with the love, do it right from the heart
Yeah, y'all know that I be out here flowin' the best
I show you my heart when I rhyme like I opened my chest
Let's go, ah, you know I'm 'bout to spit a free fo' sure
Ayo, this music is my love, mi amor
H-Mack up off the top o' this, I break it down
Ayo, I'm killin' it, I'm comin' with the sacred sound
Uh, lyrically I'm the high roller, takin' control like controller
Harry Mack, you know I'm in it, spittin' it sweeter than cola
Yeah, you know I'm leavin' my enemies broke
Uh, sweeter than cola, you know my lyrics is classic like Coke
Yeah, Mack all up on it and you gettin' destroyed

C'mon, lyrically, I'm goin' off, I'm the flowin' boss
I said my name about to bubble like soda pop

And like the wall behind you, I'm the dream catcher
Yeah, ayo, they love the way I'm bustin'
While she's peepin' out my flows, she be readjustin'
Uh, and y'all know I can do it high or sober
So impressed by the flow, got 'er fallin' over

Showin' 'em all how it could be
Shout to my girl who be clappin' her hands and rockin' the purple hoodie
Yeah, I'm breakin' down, like, everything I see
I'm comin' with the lyrics that are totally free
Uh, ayo, yo' mind, that's just what I'm provokin'
Right now she's openin' the joint case open
Yeah, soon she'll be smokin', y'all know I ain't jokin'
Yeah, y'all can't see me like I'm invisibility cloakin'
Uh, I'ma break 'em down with the notion
And like your Omegle setup, I leave the mic broken!

[[C]]
Uh, H-Mack, I'm tapping in to rap again
He was like, "Yo, I can't believe this shit is happening!"
Damn, I got that powerful flow
He's like, "I watched your video half an hour ago!"
Now we're really tapped in, live on Omegle
How the fuck does this shit happen to people?
I told my man, trust me it will all be good
I stretch from LA out to Bollywood!
Uh, I'm leaving all my enemies with a bent flow
I tell my story in reverse like Memento
He was like, "Yo, that's a classic dawg you need this
So check the Bollywood version, it's like a remix"
I'm coming off the top, yeah, my flow stay on point
I be sippin' on my bottle, I be smoking on my joint
I be sippin' on my liquor, I be puffin' on my weed
Got my bottle and my joint, guess that's everything I need
Uh, killin' the circle, I got them laughing like Urkel
You know I'm rolling my joint, uh, you know its full of the purple
Purple like Barney, no one can harm me
Purple like bruises, I never lose this
When I come off of the top of the dome you know it's exclusive
I'm getting busy, he made the stank face
'Cause of the way I'm doing my rhymes
Uh, now he be nodding his head, you know that he's having a wonderful time
Uh, Mack come up off the top, you know I'm in it
They enjoy, until I kick these rappers in the groin
I'm leaving y'all destroyed, these rappers get annoyed
Shout out to my homie in India, that's my boy!
Uh, I hope the people out there keeping focused
Hurt my heart to hear you still having spikes in the COVID
Trend still going up, I hope y'all can flatten that
Yeah, I be living in the LA habitat
Coming off the tip of this, you know my lyrics seem tight
Peace my dude up in the black shirt with the green lights
Mack all up on it now he throws the peace sign
He can't believe he really linked up for these beast rhymes
Getting down yo, I'm all up in the place
I'm blessed to put a motherfuckin' smile on your face

[[D]]
Ayo, I'm gettin' busy doin' what they can't
Graffiti artist, I'ma fill the wall up with paint
Yeah, I get the ampest, peace my man who's lampin'
Said it's like I'm paintin', I'm fillin' up the canvas
Uh, I feel like van Gogh, you know that you see 'im
They 'bout to hang my paintings on the walls o' museums
I'm makin' moves and I'm keepin' it true
I do what I do, they hang it on the walls o' the Louvre
C'mon, it's outrageous, I'm movin' in stages
Real artists, they gon' hang up all my rhyme book pages
Yeah, I'm ready to bust, I'm makin' 'em blush
They gettin' crushed, I'm paintin' like I'm usin' a brush
Yeah, and everybody knowin' what I'm about
I'm lookin' fresh like you just went and painted your house
Yeah, Mack all up on it, man, I'm keepin' it real
It's like you paint your house for the weather, I got that seal
It's the seal of approval, you know what I do, though
Comin' off the top, I'm improvisin' with the true soul
Yeah, I got weed in the stash
Stackin' up my paper, dawg, I'm keepin' that cash
C'mon, let's make it happen, rappers, I'm transcendin' them
If you givin' me cash, it better be the Benjamins
Uh, y'all know I holla with skills
I'm gettin' hundred-dollar bills 'cause I always am ill
So let's build live, y'all know that I'm lethal
While I'm droppin' more bars for my fans on Omegle
Uh, I'm throwin' down like that, my rhymes cleaner
I be pullin' up on y'all in new Beemer
Yeah, the bars that I'm droppin' 'bout to trouble you
I'm upgradin' my whip, coppin' the B-M-W
Yeah, I'm 'bout to pull up on 'em lookin' crazy
It's 90 outside but, yo, my beemer got the A/C
Never lazy, and these rappers don't amaze me
If you want the real shit, you can go and page me
Uh, and I run shit like the mayor
I kick it like the poster on your wall, soccer player
H-Mack, comin' off the top with the raw flow
Peace to my homie kickin' it out in Chicago
You want the ill flows, you know that I got those
Chop foes, then I eat 'em all up like the tacos
Yeah, extra avocado, I hit ya
Harry Mack up off the top, I be paintin' a picture
Yeah, I said I'm fully evolved, the problem solved
Ayo, I'm rhymin' 'bout the posters all up on your walls
Yeah, I didn't forget, y'all know I'm that rhymer
I'm 'bout to hop over the Great Wall of China
Harry Mack, I cut it like a surgeon, y'all
I got these rappers topplin' just like the Berlin Wall
Come on, ay, it's crazy, I go the hardest
Speakin' of walls, I started with graffiti artists
I be out here now, man, ain't nobody like me
Peace to my homie who be rockin' in a white tee
I'ma do it better, all my lyrics soundin' clever
And right behind your head, you be hangin' up the record
Well, it makes sense, I crack your spinal, every word is final
When I flow, y'all know they gon' press it to vinyl
