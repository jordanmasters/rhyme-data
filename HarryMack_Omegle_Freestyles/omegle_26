Harry Mack, the truth, I be major

I'm a killa, just trust it
Treat the track like a pineapple
Then I'm 'bout to crush it
Yeah, juice drippin', I'm rippin', I got 'em flippin'
I'm so loose, pineapple my favorite produce
I'm coppin' that organic and causing you more panic
And every time I'm on the track, you know I get raw
Slam it down to the earth, I show 'em all what I'm worth
Yeah, I been killin' these mics since back at my birth
Hold up, that's a transition, best be payin' attention
'Cause birthday the second word that they want me to mention
We 'bout to elevate, never water it down, I'ma tell ya straight
Every time I flow it's like a birthday, celebrate!
Ay, celebration is needed, my task ain't completed
Until I got my people high like they weeded
Come on, ayo, y'all know that they feelin' my essence
Word to birthdays 'cause right now, I am so present
Yeah, ayo, y'all know I get you high like you spliffed it
Please don't get it twisted, and word to birthdays, I'm gifted
Harry Mack, man, I'm ready to attack when I snap
Kinda like a birthday gift, I came through to rap
C'mon, and y'all know I'ma flow 'til I'm dead
I'm so gifted, I should prolly have a bow on my head
I'm flowin' instead, and chillin', I'm one in a million
Killin', I'm stealin' shows like the villain
My net worth should be a billion
We 'bout to get it this year, I drop the illest quotes
I should be worth a billion 'cause I'm the billy goat
The greatest of all time, so follow 'long, now
Never weak when I'm flexin', I come with the strong style
What a pity, these rappers can't spit it gritty
They never could get with me, I represent for my city
LA, my flow is scandalous
I put it down for the city of Los Angeles
Yeah, cut you like a lightsaber 'cause my vibe is quite major
Word to cities, I be standin' taller than a skyscraper
H-Mack goin' in, I'ma run 'em
Mad complicated like a city's worth of plumbin'
H-Mack under the earth, I'm that kid
Yeah, I'm about to take the city off the grid
I'ma shut the lights down, I blackout when on my rap route
Any time the beat be soundin' fresh, I gotta act out
I be in the session workin' magic, bruh
From the city of LA out to Africa
Ayo, I told you, off the top I'm about to smash this
For the dude with the facial hair and dude in the glasses
Yeah, I'm on a word spree, I know my people heard me
Shout the homie rockin' the glasses with hair that's curly
Yeah, and I'm about to spit from my divine soul
I can see behind, bro, that you got the blinds pulled
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm doper than fuck
Unlike your blinds behind, when I rhyme, I open you up
Come on, I help you see through, I'm rockin' for my people
I'm lethal, I had to send it through right on Omegle
Yeah, and when I'm in the place, it's the jam
I make you throw your body back and put your face on your hands
H-Mack, man, I got you trippin' every time I'm rippin'
He's slippin', and y'all know I'm a boss, what I said
If you keep on doin' that, you'll knock your glasses offa your head
Harry Mack, man, you know my bars so raw when I shred
Hey, doin' it for all the people when I be live up here on the Internet
And when it be comin' to rhymes right off o' the top
They know I'm a bigger threat, and you ain't heard nobody quicker yet
Doin' the shit that I'm feelin', I'm one in a million
Whenever I'm in it, my flow is infinite, I never been timid
And every competition that I enter
Y'all know the Mack is really gonna win it
Y'all know I grab on the mic and your head I'ma spin it
He cover his eyes, you know that whenever I'm on it
I'm 'bout to improvise, you probably thought it was written
Hey, who are you kiddin', it always be offa the dome
Whenever I'm spittin'

Anytime I rap, I'm leavin' y'all shook, I got you hooked
They gon' study me, they readin' my book
Yeah, they say when he rapped, he never did it sloppily
They wanna know the facts, they checkin' out my whole biography
And my discography, to hear the lyrics I was droppin'
We do this often, the study manuals they coppin'
But no longer; how long you study, it don't even matter
'Cause there's no way you could ingest all that data
It's just too much information, by every indication
I'm 'bout to blow your mind with the improvised creation
Yeah, what's up to my man, I know you hear me, bruh
I got fans in the US out to Algeria
Yeah, this is the guest that was chosen
When I first locked in with you, you were frozen
Then you started movin', now we in the session groovin'
And I got your mood improvin' every time I grip up on the
M-I-C, I plug in like IV, I'm quick to get my fans so lively
I dig the way you smilin', man, I got you cheesin'

Ay, let's make it happen, man, y'all know they feel the wrath
Ay, addin' up my lyrics kinda like we doin' math
Ay, can't nobody get with this, I spit and leave yo' district lit
I never been no hypocrite, I'm solvin' that arithmetic
C'mon, y'all know that I'm 'bout to kick a rhyme-plus
Ay, 'cause Harry Mack ain't never a minus
Never bring your mood down, I'm never subtractin'
Unless we subtractin' the wack men, and we takin' action
Goin' forward, I'm a gorgeous guy who kicks all the flows that's fly
While I start to multiply my worth on this planet
I'ma make you listen
Word to multiplication, I be reppin' my division
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm solvin' the equations
When it comes to lyrics off the top, they knowin' I'm amazin'
Don't get mad at this, can't nobody match up to my savageness
I solve equations with no calculator and no abacus
H-Mack on a plane they ain't ready for
Yeah, I'm the king of rappin', I'm the heavy lord
Check out the way that I snap when I be gettin' so loose on these tracks
I said, what's the final word, he said chess, then said rap
Ay, 'cause chess is what I used up in my last session
Ay, they 'bout to study all my rap lessons
Manifestin' direct from the spirit, I said, 'Dawg, I rap'
He said, 'Cool, hit me, I wanna hear it'
I said, 'I need three words, it's a energy exchange
I'ma take the words you give me, then I'll spit 'em out as flames'
Any track that I be on I'm body-baggin'
Check the way I'm swaggin', I be breathin' fire like a dragon
I'ma run you over, I be makin' breakthroughs like Red Rover
And I dig the black and white T-shirt, I see you got the clover
All up on it, I'ma keep it honest, Algeria up in the house

She was like, cool, I'm up in the zone
It's a compliment fest, I also love your headphones
Mack, I'ma throw it down, right up off the tip o' this

Hoppin' on the Internet to freestyle for strangers
