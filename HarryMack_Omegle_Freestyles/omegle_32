Y'all got the cool vape with multiple shiny colors

[[E]]
I said I can do beats or a cappella
Stretch through the cosmos, flow is interstellar
Yeah, and every time I'm rhymin' with the bars
I'ma take you off to Mars, I be shinin' with the stars
Hold u', yeah, they callin' me the microphone controller
Hold it down like gravity while shinin' like the solar
Middle o' the system, I'm about to make you listen
Every time I kick a lyric, breakin' out the mental prison
Let's go, yeah, Harry Mack, y'all know I put the bars up in yo face
Ay, I'ma have you droppin' low, somethin' like the bass
Ay, all up in the shuttle, I be travelin' through space
Ay, brought some extra rocket fuel with us just in case
Yeah, every time I spit, you know it's straight loot
Rappers can't breathe in my presence, they need a space suit
Yeah, and if you didn't know, you'll know soon
Ay, y'all know I might travel from planet Earth to the Moon
Build a dome to survive, we stayin' alive
Yes, we got the drive, to us, man, the rules just don't apply
We be liftin' off, we ready when I'm rhymin', I drop heavy
And I told you I ain't petty, Harry Mack cut like machete
It's the blade, I stay sharp, man, I do it from the heart
They say you fly, Harry
I got more knowledge in my brain than a library
Every time I spit, I leave you shook, ready to cook
Man, I'm droppin' bars that's like they from a book
Might as well have wrote it, I'm the dopest
Lead y'all to the slaughter, flow is liquid water
Of this book right here, I be the author
Yeah, ayo, I break it down, I got your head shakin'
They be lovin' the vibes we creatin'
We be killin' it, there's no debatin'
Comin' through right now and I'm 'bout to rock the venue, son
Ayo, I'm stretchin' like the time and space continuum
Ayo, y'all know we never stop and we stay locked in
When it come to bars, man, they really got no options
I make the venue bust 'cause my lyrics are continuous
Never stoppin', we locked in with no option
Veltri and Mack, yo, the perfect combination
Take over the game with the freestyle domination

[[F]]
Check out the vision, stay on my mission, makin' you listen
Whenever I'm kickin' my lyrics, I makin' them fall in love with the diction
Yeah, when I spit like this, y'all know I got that vision, Harry
Ayo, I got more words inside my brain than dictionaries
Yeah, hold up, and y'all know they afflicted
This here is an addiction, I got you all addicted
It's Harry Mack, I grip it, I'm playin' with words
All the bars that I deliver, yo, they flamin' absurd
Come right up off the top o' this, lastin' until Apocalypse
The mic up in my grip and y'all know that I'm never droppin' this
Good with the words and I'm good with the vocab
Got the type o' diction that can make the people go mad
Yeah, make it understood, y'all, that boy is good, y'all
I'm 'bout to score the touchdown with plush sounds like football
I'm ready for whatever, Harry Mack, I'm 'bout to rock ya
Getcha twisted up like vodka, but football means soccer
In most other countries, so I guess I'm scorin' the goal
Yeah, when it be comin' to rhymes, I got 'em all losin' control
Yeah, I got the real soul, I hit the field goal
And y'all know I open up my chest, I'm 'bout to flow the best
I be the coldest off the tip o' this and y'all know they go mad
I said it's like we playin' football but I got no shoulder pads
Yeah, I know that they heard me, I might pop up in the jersey
They wonder 'bout the freestyle lyrics, I'm tellin' y'all that I'm worthy
H-Mack, I'm all up in it one time
We started diction, then we went to football, let me think
Y'all know I'm 'bout to make ya blink
And when he's rhymin', they be sayin' he's just live
'Cause my brain is more advanced than yo' PS5
Yeah, when I rock, you know it be the flyest jam
Like the PS5, y'all know I'm in high demand
Yeah, number one performer and I'm reppin' California
When I drop, they 'bout to line up around the corner
When I'm improvisin', I be bringin' tighter raps
My man is like, "Hold up, wait, where's the lighter at?"
Ayo, they love all the vibes I provide
Got the lighter in the air and he waves it side to side
Hold up, we on our mission and y'all know we never stop with the bomb verse
Lighters up, I turn it to a concert
When I spit, never quit, they know I'm legit
Like your imaginary lighter, y'all know that Harry's lit
