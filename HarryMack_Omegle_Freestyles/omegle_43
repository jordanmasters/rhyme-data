[[A]]
Every time I'm rhymin', man, I get the people jumpin'
Yo, my brain stay stuffed like a dumplin'
H-Mack, man, I'm really in that mood
I need a dumplin', I'm tryna eat food
Locked in the groove, your vibe I'm enhancin'
As soon as the beat drops, the women start dancin'
Mack all up in it, my flow is infinite
I step to the podium, I never been timid
Yeah, y'all know I'm the freestyle boss
When it comes to lyrics, I don't never take a loss
Flow so cold that it's covered up in frost
I be like a dumpling; why? I got sauce!
H-Mack, I be on a whole nother level
When it come to freestyles, man, I don't never settle
Enemies be spittin' and they makin' me laugh
Lyrically, you know I stretch like the neck o' giraffe
H-Mack, when it comes to freestyles, yo, I got this
Word to a giraffe 'cause I'm 'bout to get spotted
Even from a distance, my flow lasts for hours
Peace to the chick in the swimsuit with the flowers
Mack all up on it and ya know I'm 'bout to dive
Anytime I'm spittin', I'ma lift my people high
Doin' what I'm feelin', I get loosest with the words
Leavin' you disturbed with this lyrical surge
Yeah, y'all know I'm rippin' raps
Held up the Surge like, "We sippin' that!"
Got it in the can, H-Mack, I go bananas
I be goin' over your head like a bandana
Sippin' out the can, rippin' for the fans
Trippin' when I jam, got 'em flippin' over
Harry Mack, high or sober
Either way, lay 'em down, I ain't come to play around
Yeah, you can tell I'm out here slayin' now
Come off the tip and I'm hype
Yeah, y'all know I'm shinin' so bright
Ay, they see me put up a fight
Ay, I'm shining just like your lights
Ay, Mack on a whole nother level
Ay, told you I'm hot like the devil
Ay, I am no puppet, ah, nah, this here is not no Geppetto
Yeah, I got you wavin' from the shoulders
When it come to lyrics, people know that I'm colder
Heavy as a boulder, y'all know that I snap
I was like, "I rap too many times 'bout cats!"
H-yeah, you know that I'm really goin' ape
Peace to the chick who be puffin' on the vape
Yeah, y'all know I'm out here livin' my dream
Now you got it lookin' hella smoky on the scene
Yeah, y'all know I'm rappin' so free
Coverin' your mouth and you're slappin' your knee
You can't believe it, I'm doin' my thing
On your middle finger, you got a big ring
Yeah, y'all know I spit like a boss
Show me your ring, now you're flippin' me off
Hold up! Showin' me your ring like, "What it do?"
I'm like, "Hold up, wait a minute... Naw, fuck you, too!"
H-Mack, man, I'm on another plane
Yeah, kickin' hella fresh lyrics off the brain
Unh, y'all know I score from the soul
Got your hands up like this like you scorin' a goal
Listen, y'all know I explore it true
I like your vape 'cause yours is blue
Yeah, H-Mack, man, I'm never in a subtle state
They be holdin' 'em up, they got double vapes
Unh, I'ma spit 'til you wasted
You got the vape pen and you got the bracelet
Yeah, and y'all know I'm 'bout to leave the game abolished
I'm the one they got to acknowledge
Yeah, show it on the screen, let me read that
I'm about to throw it down 'cause I need that
Yeah, and y'all know I'm about to smash through
Ayo, good for you, I got vaxxed, too!


[[B]]
Ay, come off the top and I'm rappin' pure
All o' my bars is spectacular
Mack, I be blowin' your mind, I'm flowin' divine
When kickin' the magic words
Yeah, you know I'm comin' to rock 'em for sure
When I be spittin', your jaw's on the floor
I got it droppin' for sure
Mack off the top and I'm pure
Never be slippin' whenever I'm rippin', I'm usin' the words, they cannot hate
Ay, every time that I'm rappin', they say I'm spectacular, I'm way too great
Say I'm incredible, say I'm amazing
Grab on the mic and I'm lyrically blazing
I'm at the pinnacle, I'm at the peak o' this
I am the greatest, yes, I am here speakin' it
Into existence, I work with persistence
I know that I'm climbin', I'm shinin', I'm gettin' what I deserve
Ay, I get too fly with words
Ay, they want the real, then I emerge
Ay, magically out o' the fog
When it be comin' to raps off the top, the people be callin' me god
Listen, I love all my people and there ain't no denyin'
And when I speak on women, I am not objectifyin'
Never that, man, my level here is godly
Human beings are human beings, they not just bodies
Come on, let's treat each other with some dignity
Let's lift each other up while I spit these frees
Yeah, too many people out there hatin'
Yeah, that's the reason we arguin' 'n debatin'
I'm not in tune with Satan, I'm more in tune with heaven
I lift off like a angel, my amp on level eleven
I ain't preachin' like a reverend, this ain't about no religion
This 'bout human beings workin' together up on this mission
I speak with my vision, 20/20
I got lyrics aplenty
I get you twisted like Henny
One of the greatest of emcees
Come off the tip o' the dome when I'm throwin' it down and they knowin' my name
Every time that I'm spittin' right off o' the top, man, they knowin' I'm flowin' insane
Okay, spectacular, then objectifyin'
I forgot the third word, yo, I'm not even denyin'
Please remind me... What was it?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I does this
Listen, y'all know that I get the loosest when I'm on a rhyme spree
Shoulda remembered that it's "inspirational" 'cause yo, that word, it defines me
Yeah, I'm out here spittin' the fire
Whenever I'm rhymin', I'm lifting you higher
And every time that I rhyme for the people that's live on Omegle, I get 'em inspired
Yeah, inspirin', kinda like a paintin' by Claude Monet
Unh, unh, inspirin' like a TV show that you binge for days
Unh, unh, yeah, inspirin' like a great book that you read from cover to cover
Yeah, inspirin' like when you see two elder people that's lovers
Ay, inspirin' like when you see a baby boy that's been born all up out the womb
And you know it will grow into an adult real soon
Inspirin' like when you see a child that smiles, when they havin' fun with they homies
Yeah, inspirin' like when you finally see your friend after years bein' lonely
Yeah, inspirin' like a beautiful sunset, inspirin' like the rhythm from a drum set
Inspirin' when you start tryin' new things you ain't done yet
Inspirin' like when you hop out a plane with a parachute on for the skydive
Yeah, inspirin' all my people when I bring in my vibes
Yeah, I inspire like a mountain range, unh, you know my style's too strange
Unh, I go against the grain
Unh, everything I spit insane
Yeah, I come off the tip and y'all know that my flow's true
You was askin' all about my YouTube, I was like, "Hold up, lemme show you!"

[[C]]
Ay, I get it started, no stoppin' me
I'm bendin' rappers outta shape like isosceles
Unh, and when it comes to lyrics, they know that I'm quite fatal
Shapin' up like isosceles triangle
Yeah, comin' through, y'all know they can't mess with me
Word to isosceles, turn up my degrees
H-Mack, man, y'all know I leave 'em strangled
I'm about to hit the game from a different angle
Doin' what I'm feelin', my lyrics one in a million
I told you I be the billy goat, I'm gon' be worth a billion
It's Harry Mack, I be brilliant whenever I'm out here spittin'
I'm doin' it off the top o' this, verses is never written
Let's go, and I'm the one these rappers wanna be
Talkin' isosceles, like it's geometry
Well, it makes sense 'cause you know I'm spittin' through mad static
Ayo, I'm addin' up my stacks, call it mathematics
I'm back up on it and I'm 'bout to throw down
I be a king up in this thing, I should be rockin' a crown
They lovin' the sound forever, man, I'm keepin' it dope
Wanna meet me, better float, 'cause I got me a moat
I'm in the kingdom, believe me, these other rappers is assholes
I'm graduatin' with a cap 'n the tassel up in my castle
I'm doin' it proper, I'm 'bout to chop ya, I'm here to rock ya
I kick it like soccer, I getcha twisted like vodka
Hold up, y'all know I'm chillin', dawg, you know we get paid
Shouts out to my homie, he done lifted up the shades
Seein' me clear 'cause the Mack about to smash this
Rockin' the button-up shirt and sunglasses
I'm still up on it, the people know that I'm the man
Now let me break down the rap Venn diagram
This side is hip hop, this side is freestyle
And my name's up in the middle 'cause I be wild
Ayo, people love the way that I be snappin'
Yeah, hip hop and freestyle, they overlappin'
Two circles combine so y'all can peep the way that I spray
Every time that I deliver a phrase
Yeah, I'm all up on it and I gotta rock my people
Ayo, I had to tap in on Omegle
Yo, over all these instrumentals I be struttin'
My homie's like, "It's nothin'," the shirt is unbuttoned
He got it open wide, ain't no way to survive
Wonderin' why these other emcees would even try
Still up on it, and y'all know I drop anthems
Dude, you killed it with those words, those were random!
Normally when I say, "Yo, I'm 'bout to do a rap...
...I need three random words," it's like, "Cat, bat, hat..."
I'm like, "Come on, dawg, I'm 'bout to knock this loose...
...You really got me up here rhymin' like I'm Dr. Seuss?!"
But not with you, you came through with mad math terms
So I could light it up and let my raps burn
Ayo, pain, I alleviate that
You did your part with those words, dawg, I appreciate that
Let's go!
