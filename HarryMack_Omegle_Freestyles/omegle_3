[[A]]

Everytime I improvise I be bringing the swag
I keep a lot of books all up in my bag
I'm that cat who raps, known for rocking snapbacks
And I got a big speaker in my back pack
I'm always breaking the rules
I got a loaded book bag like I'm going to school
I remember back in the days in college
I had the book bag so I could carry all the knowledge
Rappers get abolished, I'm filling up the room
Kinda like the scent of your favorite perfume
Yeah, I'm holy just like an apostle
I hit like your favorite perfume right to the nostril
(Uh) I got some stories that I'm telling right
(Uh) off the perfume I be smelling right
Yeah, Mack bout to stay in the zone
I don't use perfume, but I do use cologne
H-Mack I'm all up on it
You know that your odor's bent
Until you hop out of the shower and use that deodorant
Uh we getting past the B.O.
It's Harry Mack y'all know I'm off top with the free flow
Ok, I rap. Why? Cause I can't sing
But still I'm an artist just like a painting
Yeah, I improvise with the hot flow
It's like my first name Pablo, last Picasso
Uh, I'm going places where they can't go
I'm off the handle do self portraits like Van Gogh
(Uh) they thinking that they better I say no way
In fact I'm bout to paint you a flower like I was Monet
Listen, for all the darkness I'mma bring the remedy
She said "I can't believe all your positive energy!"
I said "Really? Damn. Well, what do you mean?"
She said "You radiate with positivity through the screen"
A'ight dope. Well listen, I'm the rhyme programmer
I said where you at? She said Louisiana
That's dope, well I'mma represent all day
I said kinda like your state I'm in L.A.
The other L.A., because that's the abbreviation
I grab the mic and then I cause pain alleviation
Ain't it crazy how I'm spittin' absurd?
When just a minute ago you couldn't think of no words
Ha, I said, just look around your room
And I'mma put it all inside a freestyle soon
I'mma show you what rap love is about
She can't believe what I'm spitting, she straight up covers her mouth
Yeah Harry Mack up on it, you know I'm spitting live
And when it comes to lyrics dog they cannot survive
You know that I rap off the head
Got so excited by the flow she fell back on her bed

[[B]]
I'mma put it down right now,
Harry Mack coming through with the style
I'mma bout to get busy in the mix
I'mma break em' all up with the fix
Yeah, they never bored of my flows
Got flavor like Oreos
Harry Mack do it big, they little
(Uh) My flow stays stuffed in the middle
(Uh) Y'all know that I'm smoother than silk
Tasting like an Oreo, dipped in the milk
Mack getting down, you know that I shook these rappers
Cause I got flavor like cookies
I be getting down all up on the beat
Everytime I kick lyrics man you know the shit's heat
Harry Mack representing and I'm non-discrete
Kinda like an Oreo cause my flow's so sweet
(Yeah) coming off the top when I do this
(Uh) I be meditating like a buddhist
(Uh) Lyrically, I'll be hocking lots of phlegm
For me this is oxygen
I need music to breathe, Yeah it's rare
Matter fact I'll be filling up with the air
Harry Mack you know I'm really bout to get it done
Said I'm breathing in my lyrics they be swelling in my lungs
(Uh) Puffing out my chest, man I'm doing this the best (yeah)
You know I'm breathing that in
You know that he has just been
In the zone y'all once again (Uh)
Put it down and they peeping the notion
Y'all know I got these MC's overdosing
Matter fact when it be coming to all my maneuvers
My lyrics is smoother than lotion
(Yeah) I'm bout to do it again
(Uh) They rub my flow in their skin
(Uh) You know I'm turning it up
When I be rhyming they standing on up
They out of their chairs, I'm spittin' it rare
I do it off top I don't even prepare
(Uh) and you know I do it good G
And my man he be in the pink hoodie
(Yeah) I'll be rocking 'til I'm dead
My man in the black hat nodding his head
(Yeah) You know that I rap fat
Me and my man both got on the snapbacks backwards
You know that I'm coming off the tip
Harry Mack when it comes to lyrics you know that I'm sick
(Yeah) and you know I've never been an actor
I said what's good man are y'all some rappers?
He said I just do it for fun
But this dude over here, he be getting it done
(Yeah) He be doing it professional level
And that means that he's never gonna settle
Mack get you high like the treble when I'm on it I'm controlling
Go to Jupiter, like a Roland
(Yeah) and I been much wiser
I be talking about the synthesizer
All up on your t-shirt, he ain't even notice
When it comes to rhymes rappers can't even focus
I'm so sick, everytime I spit I'm like a spliff when you rolled it
Getting you higher, I'm spitting the fire
I do it for my people when I'm live on Omegle
We throwing it down
My name really going around (Uh)
(yeah) and I'm banging the place
When I do it double time he showing his stank face
He's like stop dog, you gotta cut it off
You gotta quit right now you a fucking boss
Harry Mack man you know when I'm flowing
The show never stops it just keeps on going

[[C]]

(Yeah) When it comes to bars I'm nice
Steppin' up to me, then you 'bout to pay the price
Cause' I'll be gettin' fly, in all the cypher circles
Plus I am a master like I was a Ninja Turtle
Comin' off the head, you know I'm 'bout to reach ya
I'm not the Ninja Turtles but I am obsessed with Pizza
(Yeah) and you funky like manure
You must be a Ninja Turtle dog, you smellin' like the sewer
That's what I tell my enemies, holy sweet jesus
Peace to my man in the red tee from Adidas
(Yeah) I'm gettin' down nonstop for certain
My God, I'm hollerin' at all of my dogs
I'm amazing and I'm never gon' fail
These rappers kinda like some dogs how they chasing they tail
But me I keep it movin' all the way free, I'm here to spark
Where my dogs at? Go 'head gimme a bark
(Yeah) Ayo I do what I must
I grip up on the microphone and then I lyrically bust
And I'm about to spit the fire man, 'till I retire man
In a major way, I save the day, like Iron Man
(Uh) Ayo my eyes they sparkle
I'm a super hero like I'm coming from Marvel
(Yeah) I'm on another plane turn me up louder
He said "Can I ruin your childhood? See Bowser
Was never a turtle, more like a tortoise"
He was like "are we really live can I record this?"
(Yeah) My freestyles will never end
Then he held up his tortoise and said "This is my friend"
I said "Damn, that tortoise looks real cold
breaking the mold, told me that it's 3 years old"
No doubt, that's dope, it's Mack I'm on another plane
I'll be kickin' all of my lyrics off my fucking brain
(Yeah) Ayo I'm still flowing 'cause I'm not dead yet
Peace to my homie in Adidas and the headset
Mack comin' off of the top
Once I get started you know my lyrics never gon' stop

[[D]]

You ain't even gotta ask
When the beat drops, I will for sure rock
I said "Where you at?" He said "I'm in my workshop"
"Well, what's the location right now today?"
He said "I'm not in the US, I'm in the UK"
I'm in a whole 'nother part of the world
But I have a toy used for both boys and girls
If you give me a minute, and if it won't stop
Well I can run to the other room and grab my prop
I said "No problem man, I'll still be here"
Then I'll break it down in rhyme form and make it clear
He held it up for me I said "what is that?"
He said "It's a sex toy, and it's quite fat!"
It's called the Humpus!
And it lasts forever, whether alone or together
It can fill ya with pleasure
It doesn't matter, it can hit a woman or a man
Let me break it down for ya let you understand
Oh my god it's unbelieveable
It has female attachments and speed control
It has everything you need, kinda like my ill flow
Ayo it has a sleeve or it has a dildo!
It just depends, you can use it with friends
You can use it once, twice, then use it again
Yo my man's a mad scientist, inventor, you dead right
He said "Pretty soon yeah we gon' fix up the website"
Very excited to hit the market (yeah)
And he's about to strike all targets
(Uh) Ya'll know that I be nice on the mic
His product's perfect if you needed some spice in your life
You know how it goes, when you all on the scene
With your woman for a while it becomes routine
You need to find new ways to add excitement
(Yeah) Before I saw your product dog I was quite bent
Wondering what it would be, now I can see
I be improvising live while I'm kickin' the free
And when I get busy on the mic people jump up
If you wanna support my man, buy the Humpus!
