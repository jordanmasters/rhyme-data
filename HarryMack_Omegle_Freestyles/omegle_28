[[A]]
Yeah, I do it better than ever before
H-Mack, I be hard to the core
I open up my brain, then I get ready to explore
All these tracks get crushed like marshmallows in s'mores
Mack goin' much deeper when I'm rockin' this
In fact, I'm 'bout to melt you down like the s'more chocolate
Mack goin' deeper, I never been no damn liar
Fryin' rappers like some marshmallows in the campfire
I go deep, check the way that I move
When it comes to lyrics on the daily basis, I improve
I just lock into the groove and I'm doin' rappers harm
I be eatin' marshmallows in the mornin', Lucky Charms
Yeah, all about the cereal, I work a miracle
Grand Imperial when it comes time to get lyrical
Doin' this for all my peeps, I'm ridin' beats
And somethin' like a marshmallow, Mack is too sweet
Hold up, I kick a rhyme on Omegle and they love me
Yeah, all my bars is cute like a puppy
Matter fact, naw, scratch that, 'cause I spit raw
I never cute like puppy, I be savage like a big dog
Ay, comin' off the tip, press a threat
Ay, shouts to all the puppies, I got love for all the pets
Comin' through swiftly, hah, I'm the one that they heard
Got love for pets, puppies, cats and birds
All different types, to rap, it be my honor
Crawlin' over instrumentals just like an iguana
Blend in like chameleon, I know my people feelin' him
Yeah, through many different stages I really been
I'ma make it happen and I leave you rappers shook
Ay, you go deep when list'nin' to my flows like reading books
Hold up, I see the future when I spit 'cause I'm a visionary
When they listen to Harry, I drop more words than dictionaries
And y'all know I do it for the rap lovers
Whether on hard or soft cover, you can peep it
I kick a bar, they say, "You fly, Harry!"
Knowledge in my brain more expansive than a library
Unh, yo, this rap here was a good start
To keep your place, you gon' prolly need a bookmark
Yeah, y'all know that I'm fresh with the rhymes
Word to the backs of books 'cause my lyrics crack spines
H-Mack, man, you know my flow is vital
Check the spine of the book and you can read the title
Unh, when I'm in the library spittin' mad flames
My boards is organized by the author's last name
Yeah, so come and peep and take a listen
I be organized like the Dewey Decimal System
H-Mack comin' off the top, I break it down
Yes, I'm very hard, scan it like your library card
Doin' this for all the peeps and y'all know we never stress
Like the flag in your background, pray more, worry less
Yeah, I read what I see, I'm off the head, fam
She be reppin' New Orleans with the blue headband
Mack still up on it, I'ma do my thing
Like what you got hangin' off your lobe, I'm in the ring
But it's the cypher circle and I'm doin' what I must
Ready to bust, all these other rappers got to adjust
They gettin' crushed 'cause I'm goin' where they can't go
Nice taste, I can see the Starry Night done by van Gogh
Yeah, I'm off the top, I'm going where they never went
Yeah, classic art all up on the print
C'mon, I keep it movin', Harry Mack, I be that butterfly
Lyricist that's takin' off like butterfly
Smother all these other guys, make your moves constantly
When they hear me rhymin', they be knowin' I'm a bomb emcee
Yeah, I'm still here, and you know they like, "He said what?"
I popped in, she said, "Yo, I really dig your setup...
...Mic with the pop filter," now you see the use
Every time I'm rhymin', I be settin' it loose
Let's go!

[[B]]
Every time that Mack rhymes, man, he goes the hardest
When I'm rhymin', I be shinin' like the golden arches
Yeah, all these rappers hear me spittin' and they want mo'
More than a billion served, just like McDonald's
Come off the top when I improvise, I chop these rappers up into fries
Doin' my thing and I'm idolized, never be writin', man, I improvise
Come off the top of this, doin' my thing
All to my lyrics they tryin' to cling
I'ma serve you murder, ay
Grillin' you up like a burger, ay
H-Mack, and you know I got everything that y'all need
Ay, grillin' rappers just like a burger, and then I'm 'bout to melt that cheese
Hold up, speakin' of cheese, I be gettin' to the dough
H-Mack off the top with the lyrical flow
Ay, lyrically I get this done
Crush these tracks like a burger in the bun
H-Mack comin' off the tip o' the mental
Every time I rhyme, it's essential
Ay, ay, step outta line, I'ma crack your dental
Showin' y'all what I been through
Ay, improvised live off-top
H-Mack, you know that I'm never gonna stop
Mic, it stays so firm in my grip and it's never gonna slip and it's never gonna drop
C'mon, H-Mack, ay, that boy got it goin' on
Lyrics that I kick, you catch 'em all, word to Pokémon
Yeah, when it comes to lyrics, dawg, y'all know Mack's flexin'
Ay, I'ma catch 'em all, homie, call me Ash Ketchum
I ain't never stop, I shock whenever I speak to you
I throw a lightnin' bolt through the screen, so they compare me to Pikachu
When every time that I rip off top, they know that I'm goin' hard with bars
I got the lyrics that y'all gonna'dmire and I breathe the fire like Charizard
What! Off o' the tip o' the mental, H-Mack, y'all know I'm 'bout to get it done
Ay, anytime I'm all up in the session, people be knowin' that I'm shinin' like a sun
Ay, Mack really goin' in hard
Ay, Mack really throwin' them bars
Ay, all of my rhymes are collectible
Ay, kinda like Pokémon cards
Ay, come off the top with the remedy
My flow wet kinda like the water energy
Matter fact, I got the lyrics you admire
Need a different energy 'cause I'ma spit the fire
H-Mack, I be comin' off the tip o' this, my lyrics are ridiculous
There's no way to get rid of this
I do it for my people when I'm live up on Omegle
And you know my flow is lethal, I be sharper than a needle
I'm a hitcha, I'ma paint a picture every time I throw it down
You know that my lyrics never subtle, son
Ay, I heard this rapper, he blows bubblegum
Ay, I come right off the tip, you know my flow is vicious
Ay, my name is known around the world like Bubblicious
Ay, all these rapper are fictitious
Ay, y'all know that I been the best, all my lyrics like the gum, Winterfresh
'Cause they fresh as fuck and they also cold as snow
Ay, fresh plus they cold, that's the Winterfresh fo' sho', minds I blow
I'm about to spell it out every single time that I tell about
My lyrics, I ain't never subtle when
Come off the top like Doublemint
Gum, double the trouble, double the pleasure
Double the rhymes, I'm about to do it forever
Ay, H-mack and I stay in the pocket
Mic in my grip, I ain't never gonna drop it

[[C]]
Ayo, he said, "Are you about to do a trick for me?"
I said, kind of, but I'ma do it differently
'Cause, see, the rhymes I deliver, they are fully absurd
Before I do my magic trick, I'm 'bout to need three words
Unh, H-Mack, I be strikin' the song
I'm workin' magic, check the way I turn the mic to a wand
I'm comin' off the tip o' this, these tracks, I stay lacin'
Plugged into yo' vibe like we playin' PlayStation
Holdin' the controller, I'm the high roller
Thought I told ya, heavy like a boulder
All my lyrics soundin' colder, c'mon
I really enlist in hip hop and all o' this
PlayStation, I'ma pull out the disc
Yeah, got it on a CD-ROM, let's put it all up in the console
Lyrics that I'm kickin' are beyond swoll'
Yeah, and all my lyrics be the hardest
But my favorite console didn't use a disc, it used a cartridge
I'm talkin' 'bout N64, I hope y'all get the message
When it be comin' to bars right off o' the tip o' the mental
No one can test this
Yeah, and I always spit it phat
Never hear me with a flow that's whack
My styles is throwback just like PlayStation 1
We gettin' it done
H-Mack, whenever I'm rhymin', y'all know that I shine like the sun
Come on, hot in the session, I be slayin' them lames
Word to PlayStation, but Mack ain't even playin' no games
Hold up, ay, for me to change the game, it is nothin'
It's like I'm holdin' the controller 'cause I'm pressin' the button
To cause ultimate devastation when I'm up in the zone
Rhymes get directed, mind stays connected like phone
Hold up, yeah, they know that they styles get stuck
If you want some real skills, y'all can dial me up
H-Mack, man, y'all know that I spit it so divine
Ay, I give my phone number, you can hit me on my line
Hold up, wait a second, then again, that could cause a bigger threat
If I give you my phone number on the Internet
I'm just bein' honest, H-Mack, I'm here to flex
Ay, you can dial my number or hit me with a text
Ay, word to a text 'cause I'ma deliver the message
And when it comes to freestyles, can't nobody test it
I manifest it, I come through with the free vocals
Connected like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile
Pick your provider, I'm sick in the cypher
H-Mack, every time I rip, they get hyper
Yeah, and I'm about to tell you, sir
Tapped in wherever I'm at, like cellular
I'm plugged into the tower, rappers get devoured
When they locked into my flow station
Due to my phone, they know my location
Government trackin' from how I be rappin'
They like, "What's goin' on with this magician named Harry Mack'n?"
They wanna see exactly how I do it
Y'all know I get the loosest when I kick the fluid
Y'all shoulda knew it from the beginnin', I'm winnin'
And y'all know I'm that kid
They tracked my phone location from the towers up on the grid
Now they know where I'm at and they know what I buy
And they know how I rap and they know that I'm fly
And they know I do songs for people on screens
And they know 'bout my producer, they know 'bout my team
I think they know 'bout my address
They surely know my phone number
Yeah, they could find me whether winter, fall or summer
Regardless of the season, phone lets them track me
I'm just droppin' facts, G, this is Harry Mack, G
Check the way we on it, man, I'm stayin' on my creep
Rappers don't know nothin' 'bout me 'cause they always stay asleep
Every time I spit, I'm dope, I be fillin' y'all with hope
All these rappers, they were sleepin', but when I spit, I be woke
C'mon, and y'all know these rappers really do me harm, not
I'ma wake you up in the mornin' like an alarm clock
Can't nobody stop me, they fall asleep, they drop, G
While I don't spit saliva, I be spittin' raw coffee
Yeah, H-Mack off the top, I kick a fresh flow
Am I the best, bro? Wake ya like espresso
Doin' what I'm feelin', I'ma keep it free
That free emcee, so homie, never sleep on me
'S like that!

[[D]]
Yeah, all o' my lyrics is rare
Ay, I get you out o' your chair
Ay, every time I'm on the beat
Ay, I get you right on your feet
Ay, they love the way that I spit
Out o' your chair, ain't no time to sit
Ay, I'm 'bout to make 'em all move
When I be rappin', I make y'all improve
C'mon, y'all know my session is hectic
Killin' these beats, the chair was electric
Ay, they all get executed
Ay, my bars cannot be computed
Ay, I got one shot, I'ma shoot it
Ay, y'all know we never get muted
Ay, I'm here to rock for my people
I'm sayin' wassup to both y'all on Omegle
I'm live all in the session, I'm makin' it happen, I'm leavin' you floored
I said, What y'all really got goin' on?
They said, "Nothin' much, we were just bored...
...So we hopped on Omegle to see what's goin' on."
Now you're listenin' to the rapper who be really flowin' strong
Every time that I grab it and you know I'm 'bout to damage ya
Harry Mack no amateur, I'm live up on the camera
Yeah, I'm here to rock for my friends
I said I'm live up on your camera lens
C'mon, when I'm in it, man, you know I'm 'bout to turn you to a dead man
Every time I'm live on the webcam
We be stayin' up on it, we make it happen
I be snappin', takin' action when rappin'
Yeah, you gon' hit the picture with the caption
When you post it on IG, I'm lively
Come right off the top of this, you know I'm 'bout to smash this
Rappers couldn't see me even if they wearin' glasses
H-Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to show ya
Ay, all these rappers is about to get run ovah
Ay, and I make it understood
They be like, Wow, he's actually good
Ay, I kinda put my words together well
Every time I'm rappin', I'm about to excel
I got what you like when I'm live on the mic
Ay, rappers are my type
Ay, y'all know that she's rockin' in the stripes
With the light blue and the light pink
Harry Mack, when I'm rhymin', I'm about to make you think
Yeah, y'all know that these rappers need to do better
Shout to the girl rockin' in the blue sweater
Yeah, and this rappin' domination
While I'm spittin', they be havin' like a conversation
Come on, now they fist goes up to they nose
'Cause they can't believe how I kick the flows
Harry Mack put the work in constantly
I'ma kill the game and I think it really shows
Ay, now I got her crackin' up
Every time I'm rappin', they be backin' up
You know I got 'em laughin' 'cause I'm comin' off the top o' this
And bringin' all the passion, me and instrumentals
Y'all know that we never really clashin'
And I got her smilin', she cannot believe the shit I'm sayin'
Now I got your jaw droppin', I do it too often
Yeah, I'm 'bout to whip up a brand new concoction
Ay, mic in my grip, never droppin'
Ay, y'all know I'm kickin' my lyrics right offa the head
They was like, we are just chillin' right here on Omegle
We sittin' in front of our bed
Yeah, y'all know I come with the ill flow
In the back, I see black and red on the pillow
Y'all know I kill foes
Started real nice and y'all know that I'm still dope
Doin' it just for my people, they lovin' the way I'm freestylin'
I'm happy to have 'em all laughin' whenever I'm rappin'
I keep 'em all smilin'
