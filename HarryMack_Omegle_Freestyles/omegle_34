[[A]]
Yeah, yeah, unh, unh, yo, yo, yo
Check out the vibes I bring
Ay, love it when I do my thing
Ay, Harry Mack stay in the zone
I be sittin' in the throne, I be feelin' like a king
Ay, y'all know it 'bout to go down
Everybody really 'bout to fuck with my sound
Yeah, y'all know I live like a king in this piece
I should just be rockin' a crown
Goin' over heads kinda like the gold
When it come to rhymin', I'm about to break the mold
Ay, every time I spit, I'm cold
Flow off the top and my story gets told
Do what I'm feelin' for all o' my people
You said you got lyrics, you better go bring some
I do not live in a house
Ay, I'm in control of a kingdom
I live in a castle and it's got a moat
When it be comin' to lyrics, I'm dope
Rappers, they hear what I'm sayin', they writin' it down
And they takin' them notes, they droppin' them quotes
I'm ready for war
Ay, off o' the top, I be givin' y'all more
747 in the sky, I soar
All these other rappers, they some real eyesores
Mack all up on it, I'm about to keep it honest
And I get loose when I'm in the cypher
Ay, when it come to lyrics off the top o' the mental
I'm earnin' more stripes than a tiger
Yeah, and I kill it when I'm cyphering
People, they lovin' all the hype I bring
Matter fact, I'ma combine the first two words
They gon' binge me like Tiger King
Ay, Mack, I'ma make the connection
Ay, y'all know they feel the affection
Ay, y'all know I got 'em all laughin'
I'm comin' off the top and I'm spittin' with passion
Get on the mic and I never done lost it
I'm Tiger King like I was Joe Exotic
Mack off the the tip o' this, droppin' the character
Come with the lyrics that's sure to embarrass ya
Rapper should prolly back down
Ay, I get loose with the sound
Ay, I kick rhymes for my peeps
Ay, then they 'bout to surround
H'eah, they gon' call me a god
Ay, I don't need a façade
Oh, now I understand why you threw the word dog
Yeah, I hear it barkin' all in the back
Y'all now are tuned to the Harry to the Mack
H'eah, you know it's 'bout to go down
I hear the dog 'cause it's makin' mad sound
Yeah, y'all know I spit from the soul
When comin' to lyrics, I stay on the roll
I hear it barkin', it's barkin' and yappin' and yappin'
Yo, get that dog under control!
Ay, Mack, I'ma hold it down
Told you, I be in a holy crown
I be the K to the I to the N G
When it come to lyrics, I never been friendly
Crushin' these emcees, doin' what I must
Steppin' up to me, you about to get crushed
Stayin' on my route, let 'em know what I'm about
All these other rappers, they gon' do it only for the clout
Yeah, I'ma make your speakers go BOOM!
Ya homie got up and went to the next room
Yeah, y'all know that I'm spiritual
Ay, in the other room, can you hear my flow?
Ay, hope that we still connect
And when I drop the rhymes, you know I'm in effect
H-Mack, man, I'm droppin' more intellect
Yeah, I'm the type o' rapper they can't disrespect
Hey, do what I feel when it's out o' the mouth
Peace the girl who just chills on the couch
Mack, I be doin' the shit that I want
Grab on the mic and I'm ready to flaunt
Yeah, y'all know I'ma put a rapper in a tomb
She's like, I just locked my dog in the other freakin' room!


[[B]]
One two, one two, one two, one two, let's get it, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
From LA to India, we connectin'
Ay, From LA to India, ay, check it
Rappers be hearin' me rhymin'
Ay, when that shit happens, they always sour
You know I'm good for your health
Ay, kinda like eatin' some cauliflower
Mack off the top o' the brain
Ay, kickin' the lyrics, you know that they deadly
Eatin' my cauliflower and my broccoli
'Cause I'm in love with the veggies
Yeah, I be the best one
Representin' when I'm live on the scene
Yeah, said I'm in love with my veggies
Ay, I be in love with my greens
Ay, gettin' my protein
Yeah, gettin' like all o' my vitamins
I be so dope with the lyrics, the people just thought I was writin' them
Comin' right off o' the top and providin' them
Homie, I'm enterin' all in my zone
Yeah, when it be comin' to lyrics
Y'all know that I just couldn't leave 'em alone
Yeah, y'all know I be illin'
Ay, off the top I'm spillin'
Ay, y'all know we organic, got that cauliflower grillin'
Ay, we gon' make it happen, man, I told ya there's no stoppin' me
Compared to me, rappers similar but different, like cauliflower to broccoli
Not quite the same!
Ay, y'all can't really be in my lane
When it comes to rhymes, I'm insane
I be fillin' it all up with pain
Do what I feel right now and I leave ya in amazement
Comin' with the rhymes, y'all better just embrace this
Yeah, I said, hold up, lemme pull up the dictionary just to look up ostentatious
Yeah, had to get the definition, now I understand how it goes
Ay, every time I'm rhymin' off the top o' the mental, I be gettin' loose with the flows
Yeah, yeah, Harry Mack, yo, what's he all about?
Yeah, he be livin' in that big, ostentatious house
Ay, he be drivin' 'round in that ostentatious car
Yeah, he be always flexin' with them ostentatious bars
Yeah, y'all know I be rappin', kid
I use it as a adjective
I'm pullin' up to break it down, I blow your mind with this sacred sound
Yeah, every time I spit, y'all know that they be actin' up
Ostentatious bars, but the thing is I can back 'em up
Guess that's the difference
When I'm all in they face, man, I got them flinchin'
Ay, rappers couldn't make it in music
Now they wear suits like penguins
All in the office
Yeah, I couldn't do this
Ay, I couldn't hack it
Ay, plenty o' lyrics, you know that I pack it
The track, man, you know I'ma smack it
You know I be shinin' as if I was backlit
I do what I'm feelin', I'm gettin' you high
Ay, rappers is kinda like penguins
'Cause they ain't actually fly
Ay, grip on the mic and I spark it
My bars cold like the Arctic
Cold like Antarctica
Grip the mic, then I spark it up
Yeah, even from a distance, Mack about to injure ya
That shit was random, there ain't no penguins out in India!
H-Mack, y'all know I be spittin' hella fire
I said, "Homie, how you doin?" He said, "Eh, kinda tired."
I said, "Bro, can I spit for you?" He said, "Yeah, let's make it happen."
I said, "Cool," dropped a beat
From that second on, I been steadily rappin'
Yeah, and y'all know I'm seeing through it like a X-Ray
It's 'bout the same time in India but it's the next day? Mind blown!
Ayo, live through the computer
Like, how is this man talkin' to me from the future?
It don't make sense
Yeah, you know I will entice
Yo, how is shit tomorrow, dawg? I hope it's feelin' nice

[[C]]
Yeah, okay, mm, one one two
Yeah, yeah, ay, ay, ay
The mic, I do not drop it
Every bar I spit sound hot in the pocket
H-Mack, ayo, I'm makin' people listen
I spit my vision, y'all know that pocket means rhythm
Well, my pocket hot, then, 'cause my rhythm is so dope
Rappers steppin' up to Harry Mack, they ain't got no hope
Ay, and y'all know I maintain, it's us
My mind a hot pocket, my brain is stuffed
Yeah, it's crackin' at the seams
Rappin' for the fiends
When I rhyme, it's ya life I save
Hot like out the microwave
Ayo, I do what I gotta do when I rap live up over tracks
Eatin' rappers like Hot Pockets® snack
I'm goin' for mine, flowin' divine, 'cause I'm the best
I go to beats like chair go to desk
Ay, I'm really on my level, y'all know I'm berserk
Leave you hurt, I be sittin' at my desk doin' work
Ay, I win with words, I be the wack rapper injurer
He said desk, then chair, that's too similar
I had to combine 'em, I put it in alignment
And like the red lights behind your head, I be shinin'
Yeah, and you know that the Mack has always been live
Bro, why you wearin' sunglasses inside?
H-Mack, I get live in the place
Maybe you got shades on just for hidin' your face
That makes sense, yeah, Internet security
I spit it with the purity, I cut you up like surgery
I'm 'bout to kill it certainly, from LA out to Germany
They knowin'
Comin' right off o' the tip o' the dome
Like every time that I'm flowin'
Nobody's like me
I'm diggin' deep into my psyche
I'm goin' over heads just like your beanie made by Nike
Yeah, I came off the top just to bust fluid
Word to Nike on your beanie 'cause Harry, he just do it
H'eah, I don't ever sleep, I be stayin' on the creep
When it be comin' to rhymes, they know I go deep
I said I'm doin' shit these other rappers haven't done yet
I get musical, my vibes are beautiful like a sunset
Unh, I'm here for y'all and you know that my flowin' sounds somethin' like a sunset
Why? 'Cause it's goin' down!
H-Mack, man, the people really vibin'
I said I'm beautiful like the sun at the horizon
Peep the way we in it, man, I'm 'bout to come with flowin' showers
Matter fact, my picture lookin' perfect like it's golden hour
It's Harry Mack, I be live emceein'
Yeah, and it's lookin' right like it's 5 p.m.
Hold up, I do this well, for my people do excel
I'm the illest off the top and I figured you can tell
Yeah, I came through with the vibe
Peace to the homie in the shades and the dude on the side
Yeah, ayo, when I be rhymin', they be sayin' good stuff
He got the sunglasses on and the hood up
Ayo, I be the rapper that is chosen
When you showed your homie on the side, your camera was frozen
But now, we back in effect, I rap and contract whenever I flow
It's Harry Mack, there ain't no tellin' where I'm 'bout to go
Yeah, told ya like the sun, Mack is still shinin'
After sunset when it goes down, y'all know I'm still rhymin'
What's good?!
