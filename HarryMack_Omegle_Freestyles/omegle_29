[[A]]
Every time I'm on the beat
Y'all know I'ma kill it 'cause my flow too fatal
Rappers steppin' incorrect
I might have to go ahead and disconnect your cable
I'm on a whole nother level
When I rhyme, I'ma make it look easy
Yeah, and I used to watch rappers as a kid
I would see 'em all on cable TV
Hold up, I'm about to blow your mind right now
I'm about to blow your brain
Yeah, I'm tryna get me a real thick cable 'round my neck
I be talkin' 'bout a chain
Yeah, H-Mack off the top o' the dome
Ay, and I got you goin' crazy
Ay, when it comes to puttin' work in all up on the mic
Man, I never been lazy
Hold up, obese with the speech, I be comin' with the phat sound
All these other rappers gettin' pushed to the background
Ay, I be representin' with the mean team
Pretty sure they background was a green screen
AKA, rappers need more special effects
'Cause they ain't really organic when they catchin' they wreck
And every time that I be rhymin', man, your vibe I'm enhancin'
That's the reason why both o' these people is dancin'
I'm 'bout to put it down, yeah, y'all know that I'm 'bout to throw it in
Ay, Harry Mack, we never gonna lose
E'ry time we rappin', we gon' win
Yeah, I be winnin' by like every indication
They wanna know about my background information
Basically, I was born and raised in Portland
No father to my style 'cause it's a orphan
I be comin' off the tip o' this, ridiculous
Y'all know I'm gettin' ill when I'm up in the zone
Ay, before I even started with the lyrics, she was like, "Can we film?"
Then she pulled out her phone
Ay, H-Mack, man, you know I'm comin' through real hot
And I'm 'bout to hop over the fence
Ay, they was tryna come up with words
Turned to me, said, "Sorry, we be thinkin' in French."
Heh, H-Mack, man, I know the people heard o' me
I said, Are y'all out in France? They said, "Germany."
Yeah, and I'm comin' with the raw flow
You were born in Germany, but you are from Chicago
I'm just tryna put all the facts together
When it comes to lyricism, ain't nobody better
Yeah, I get loose like every time that I rock
She said apple, no, wait, let's think outside o' the box
Yeah, when it comes to lyrics, y'all know that I'm flawless
She was like, We takin' too long, it's just a process
Yeah, any problem, we about to solve it
All these other rappers, they the pits: olive
H-Mack, y'all know that I never been a quitter
Ay, and these rappers like a olive 'cause they bitter
Ay, and these people 'round the planet, yeah, they see me
Ay, and I got the olive all in my martini
Hey, every time that I'm rippin', I'm blowin' your mind
Every time that I'm spittin', Harry Mack, I'm stayin' up on it
Y'all know that I never really be quittin'
You coverin' your mouth, they gon' love it, that's no doubt
Yeah, Mack, I'm gettin' it in, when I be on it, you know it's right now
They be turnin' me loud, cell phone case looks like a cow
Yeah, got the white background with black spots
Harry Mack, I'm blowin' up up in the rap spot
Yeah, killin' 'em when on the beat, fallin' back, showin' me feet
Harry Mack, you know that until I be finished, the mission is never complete
Ay, do what I feel whenever I'm on it, I'm leavin' a field of dead clones
Both of y'all are sharin' the headphones
One ear bud goes to one side
Other ear bud to the other side
So you don't gotta choose who's listenin'
So both of y'all can same time vibe
H-Mack, man, we 'bout to make it bounce
I be live on Omegle, man, we really in the house
I be makin' a vibe and y'all know we gettin' live
When it comes to lyricism, homie, no one can survive
I'm goin' in and I'm here to win
I'ma blow your mind, y'all, once again
Yeah, we finished right now 'cause I smashed it
I like your shirt with the woman wearin' pink glasses

[[B]]
Yeah, yeah, okay, ah, okay, ah
Yeah, all o' my lyrics are nice
Steppin' to Mack and you rollin' the dice
Ay, all of my bars are advanced
You rollin' the dice, you takin' a chance
Ay, I'm out here pressin' a threat
Rollin' the dice, they placin' they bets
They know I'm gon' win, they know what I'm 'bout
Mack'n, you know I'ma stay on my route
Yeah, I cannot hang with these fake guys
Rollin' my dice and it's snake eyes
Y'all know I'm gettin' that good luck
Offa the top with the good stuff
For all these lyrics, they beg us
They rollin' they dice like they out there in Vegas
They steppin' to Mack and they might not survive it
'Cause when it be comin' to bars, I'm the livest
I'm all up on it comin' off o' the tip
Harry Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to come through
Yeah, they can't really do what I do
When it comes to lyrics, I'm a black belt in Kung Fu
I be doin' what I feel and you know I really lock this
When it comes to rhymes, I be thinkin' out the boxes
H-Mack, man, I'm ready, I be cold, I be shivery
Box it up for the delivery
I'ma send it out to my people
When it come to lyrics, man, I'm way too lethal
Yeah, check the way I speak to you
He was doin' impersonation o' Pikachu
H-Mack, comin' off the top, no doubt
Y'all know I'm about to stay on my route
C'mon, y'all know I'm that godly dude
When I kick a lyric, I'ma make your body move
Yeah, y'all know I come through with the lyrics that's too swift
Ay, Pikachu is hard to imitate 'cause that's high-pitched
But you get it close, my dude
Yeah, you about to go have it
Ay, grab the mic and work magic
Ay, got 'em all just reactin'
I'ma do what I feel 'cause my lyrics hella major
Gettin' to the money and we stackin' up the papers
Harry Mack, y'all know I grab a mic and control it
Word to the papers 'cause ya know we 'bout to roll it up
Yeah, I told it, doin' it for y'all
When it comes to bars, I be fully evolved
Yeah, you know that I do it once again
But I don't need the papers and I don't need the pen
'Cause I improvise right up off the top, better see this
Harry Mack, you know that I'm 'bout to jot a thesis
But I don't jot it down on paper at all
I just imitate it right up off the top for y'all
Yeah, yeah, I be improvisin' live when I'm cyph'rin'
I come with the rhythm, drop the vision
I be breakin' out the mental prison
Use my intuition, I'ma spit from off of the tip right here
Ay, every time I rhyme, they 'bout to get this clear
C'mon, y'all know I'm about to grab the mic, then I run it, dude
Couldn't find a word, I said, What you see in front o' you?
He said, "I see dice, I see boxes, I see papers,"
But I betcha didn't know that I would spit it quite this major
Yeah, comin' off the top o' the mental
Bringin' all the freestyle innovation
Rappers remind me o' you doin' Pikachu
'Cause they just be my imitation

[[C]]
Come off the top and the people gon' love it
Peace to my man, Dominican Republic
He's representin', y'all know that I'm gritty
He said, My whole life, I been in one city
Yeah, I'm off the top, tried to warn ya
Ay, see me? I'm in California
Yeah, that's just the place where I'm livin'
He said, I love it, I'm tryin' to visit
Ay, I kick my bars and they thank me
He's reppin' New York on the shirt for the Yankees
Yeah, asked him if he's never been
Yeah, he knows the Yankees gon' win
Ay, hopin' he can make it out
H-Mack, you know I'ma stay on my route
Blowin' your mind with the lyrics that come from my spirit
Then they pour direct out my mouth
Yeah, doin' it for y'all every single time I rap
When the track drops, I'm about to snap
Ay, I said I do the musical arts
He said, That's cool, I paint and I act
Yeah, y'all know I'ma blow your mind every time the track stay bumpin'
Y'all know that it's thumpin'
Yeah, I said, Are you a painter? He said, Yeah
Go ahead and show me somethin'
Held up the book, he was showin' me a skull
And you see the skull, man, it has some big horns
Yeah, they were sharp at the tip, kinda like all the bars that I spit
Every time that I perform
Yeah, you blew my mind with that
Yeah, you got all kind o' art
Yeah, then you flipped it to the next page
You said, This one here really came from the heart
Ay, y'all know we be winnin' the award show
And he showed me Wanted poster for Zorro
Yeah, it was dope, dawg, he had me hooked
I said, What's the inspiration? He said, It's a comic book
Yeah, he said, But listen, you didn't know this prob'ly
When it comes to art, man, can't nobody stop me
I used black marker for the picture
But how'd I make it look old? Dawg, I used coffee!
H-Mack, plenty space, I'ma take it up
Like the coffee in your mug, I'ma wake you up
Yeah, and they love it when I'm rappin', I'm snappin'
He's diggin' the bars, that's why he's clappin'
His hands together, I be leavin' ya floored
I looked to the background and I saw your awards
Yeah, and ya know he said, That's my diploma
Yeah, took it off the wall just to show bruh
Not really, I exaggerated for the story
Other rappers all up in the industry, they bore me
Check it out, y'all know that I'm really 'bout to bring this
A diploma for art, a diploma for English
Yeah, you know that he's followin' the rules
And he's workin' real hard for the diploma up in school
H-Mack, you know that I rep for the team, G
I be goin' over heads like your green beanie
C'mon, y'all know that I really take aim
Word to your diploma but I break out o' the frame
Harry Mack, I'm all up on it
And I show ya how I do it with my style, no doubt
I should prob'ly get a spot up on Wild 'n Out
We gon' have to make it happen
Yeah, my dude said, I'm a fan of the rappin'
Yeah, the main attraction every time I'm on it
Man, I'm 'bout to make you jealous more
Then he showed me Skeletor
I was like, Oh, my god, that's a demon from He-Man
Harry Mack, I'm on it, I'm achievin'
A whole nother level and ya know they all irrelevant
It was like a real buff dude, but a skeleton
Yeah, I was feelin' that pic
Every time I rhyme, people know that I'm sick
I be thinkin' it quick whenever I'm tappin' in with all o' my people
You know that I'm blowin' your mind when I be rockin' it on Omegle
Yeah, and I got his jaw droppin' down to the floor like this
Every time that I explore brand new territor'
Man, you know we out here winnin' it
Ay, yeah, and he's outta the Dominican Republic
I love it, y'all know I'm comin' through
Got his hands in the air when I'm doin' what I do
Turn into a concert when I drop the bomb verse
Harry Mack, you know we 'bout to run around, we on first
Go to second, I reckon we slide into third
Then we slidin' into home, homie, that is my word
Knock it out the park just like the Yankees, turn it to a show
Every time I'm live on Omegle with the flow
Yeah, they know I'm stylin'
Blessed to see I got you smilin'
I'm kickin' lyrics in every direction
Dominican Republic, LA connection
