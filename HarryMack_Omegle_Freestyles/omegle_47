[[A]]
Once we get started, we never gon' stop
Go from the bottom to top
I do this rap shit a lot
Damn, this shit here is a bop
I got you noddin' your head
I keep on rhymin' 'til day that I'm dead
Ay, turn me up 'til I be peakin' way up in the red
Yeah, that's what I said
Ay, come off the top o' this, unh, I got you boppin' yo' dome
Ay, every time that I'm rockin' on my microphone, I get deep in the zone, never no clone
Ay, when I be doin' my rhymes, they quite major
Kinda like picture behind your head, I'm standin' tall as a skyscraper
Mack off the tip o' this
Ay, y'all know I truly get hot
Ay, rappers be talkin' that gibberish
They on some boopity bop!
Unh, I just can't hear what they sayin'
When they be speakin' like that, are they playin'?
Unh, enemies, that's who I'm slayin'
In my convo, they wanna weigh in
I won't let it happen, nice with the rappin', Mack is steadily takin' the action
Spittin' with passion
Ay, me and my fans on Omegle, we ain't never clashin'
Yeah, and y'all know I go hard when I spark up
Put a "be" right before the word "bop," that's the music o' Charlie Parker
That's that bebop jazz, I'm about to spaz, I'ma take you back to the '50s
Yeah, kids be watchin' me on the YouTube screen and they don't even get me
'Cause I rewind and I beeline
To the old school, keep the flow cool
Ay, every time I'm on it, I play you for the punk
Bebop music like Thelonious Monk
Dizzy Gillespie, Jo Jones all up on the drums with the rhythm comin' off the top
H-Mack, when it come to bars, I don't stop
E'erything I spit, it be way too hot
First word was bop, ay, but the second word that y'all given me
Is somethin' that we fightin' for, we passionate about liberty
Yeah, check out the way that I bust this
I kill the game and I know that you trust this
Yeah, in this life, we gotta strive for liberty and for justice
People gettin' pushed down, people held to the ground
Damn, people don't get they voices heard, they don't even make one sound
We need more liberty for all, hopin' that the planet can evolve
So many problems that we face as humans, hope that we can get all o' those solved
But we gotta work together, even when we dealin' with that pressure
That's why I hop on Omegle, to kick these freestyle bars and all o' these measures
All o' these lyrics right from the spirit
No liberty? I don't wanna hear it!
No justice? We ain't got no time for that!
Yeah, all these rappers think they sick, that's hypochondriac
But yo, my mind's intact and y'all can break it down, I got the crazy sound
Hey, everything I'm spittin' be holy, can't no one control me
Y'all know that I'm comin' through just to let 'em all know
Unh, hard to find all up in the crowd like Waldo
All these rappers claim that they stand tall? No!
They be comin' through with all the small flows
Ay, I be the number-one rapper on the scene
Y'all know rappers could never redeem
Everything I spit be soundin' too clean
Gettin' to the money, gettin' to the green
Yeah, and y'all best believe in these frees
Gettin' to the green like the leaves on the trees
Gettin' to the green like the color o' the grass
Gettin' to the green paper, we gon' count it fast
Ay, greatest off the top, I know that I'll amount to that
Ay, gettin' to the green, get the bounty and the stacks
Ay, I got the shit that you need
Yes, you said, "Green," I thought you said, "Greed"
Well, people that's greedy is hoardin' the green
Illest shit I've ever seen
Yeah, so we gotta find a way to fix that
I come right off the tip with the sick raps
And y'all can't even believe it
The Freestyle Jesus tearin' emcees to pieces
Comin' off the top with the fly poems
Ay, all around the planet, you know I'm known
And right now, you filmin' on the iPhone
Yeah, you filmin' me on your phone, you the only one with that video
You the only one with that exclusive verse listenin' to me spit the flow
Yeah, y'all know I'm keepin' it mellow
Huh, you got the white shirt on, but all on the sleeves, it's orange and it's yellow
Unh, yeah, I done seen it as soon as you lifted your arm
Everything that I spit is the bomb, H-Mack-official-dot-com
Y'all can go and hit it up
About the negativity, we don't give a fuck
Yeah, I come off the top with the strong flair
One got curly and one got long hair
I'ma call it out on the track, I'ma smash this
I'ma get the judgment from one in the glasses
Yeah, better critique this
Unh, every time I grab the mic and freak this
Unh, energy, that's what I come off the top of
Every time I speak with mad adrenaline
I be the one they rememberin'
H-Mack, improvise my lyrics, never pennin' them

[[B]]
We ain't hesitatin', we really 'bout to get it in
We workin' hard, y'all know that we vigilant
Yeah, and we stayin' so persistent
From our goals, it's not such of a distance
We 'bout to close in, feelin' like I'm the one that's chosen
So cold with the lyrics, I be frozen
Yeah, we keep it rockin', we not stoppin'
Soon as the beat's droppin', the shoulders start boppin'
Yeah, y'all know that we here to make a difference
Unh, I'm 'bout to prove in this instance
That I can be vigilant when I'm chasin' my dreams
Stay vigilant to live me amazin' schemes
Yeah, I'm 'bout to make 'em happen
And when I'm rappin', y'all know that I'm steady takin' action
Unh, I'm here for all o' y'all, my flow fully evolved
Over instrumentals I'm about to crawl
Like a cat, but wait, I rejected that, too many times
I rapped about felines in mind
So I had to switch it and get me a second word, it's piano
Now I'm droppin' lyrics off the handle
So listen, when I freestyle like this, my voice is infinite
My vocal chords is the piano, that's my instrument
Yeah, peace to everybody who's supportin'
Keyboardin', whether piano or the organ
Or maybe it's the synthesizer, we be gettin' live
Or maybe metallic bars like you playin' on the vibes
That's the vibraphone
Y'all know I'm 'bout to leave y'all injured with all type o' zones
I might be bangin' the marimba
All these different instruments combine to play the different chords
Of the music that I scorch over top of, to absorb
The factual info, I rock it like this
When I do the bar, I got your fist risin' to your lips
Now listen, I'm out here droppin' the lyrical schemes
Peace to the third person who just hopped on the screen
Nice to see you over there, I be spittin' it rare
When it be comin' to lyrics, deliverin' those with the most flair
Soon as you hop in, I'm locked in, I see that
I be gettin' loose while deliverin' the free raps
Vigilant, then piano; what's next?
Let me see if I remember while I kick the rhyme flex
I'm snappin' rappers' necks, okay, don't get mad at me
I just remembered that I gotta cause me a catastrophe
Yeah, I'm out here spittin' the flames
What would be a catastrophe? Me quittin' the game!
What would be a catastrophe? Me lockin' up the mic
Like, "I don't wanna do it, I ain't rhymin' tonight!"
It's a catastrophe if I stop chasin' my dream
It's a catastrophe if I stop spittin' it clean
It's a catastrophe if I stop lockin' in with people
Live in the streets or live on Omegle
'Cause if we can't combine with the energies
That's a catastrophe without no remedy
My lyrics catastrophic, y'all know I spit it off the brain
I cause catastrophes like a storm with acid rain
I cause catastrophes like a hurricane
Cause catastrophes like a storm that's cloggin' your storm drain
Caused so many catastrophes, too many to list
Ay, rappers is catastrophic with bars, they got me pissed
Yeah, y'all know that I get the most loosest with the free flow
Started as a duo, now we got the trio
Yeah, before they rhyme, these rappers need to think first
Shout to the homie who be clappin' in the pink shirt
And on the side, buggin' out to my rhyme scheme
We got the other friend in the shirt that's lime green
Yeah, people know I'm rapping tight
The picture on the wall behind you, it be black and white
I'm callin' all the different colors out, y'all know we gotta do work
And you, the third, I'm thinkin' it's a blue shirt
Kinda hard to tell, I did my best guess
I hop up on Omegle and I'm ready to impress
I'm comin' off top and bringin' finesse, and people be lovin' the vibe
Every time that I hop on Omegle, y'all know we ready to get this shit live
Yeah, I take a dive and I stay up in the zone
The third person watchin' me filmin' me on the phone
H-Mack, every time I'm rappin', I'ma get props
Whether it be YouTube or Omegle or TikTok

[[C]]
Yeah, my flow's the tightest
I'm feelin' honored 'cause I just got knighted
So, I'm comin' up with some new slang
Am I officially a member of the Wu-Tang?
Wow, I guess I'm 'bout to do it bigger
But I can't really get at it until I hit up RZA
I hope one day him and I are first-name basis
Imagine that happenin' to Mack, it's amazin'
Yeah, I'm 'bout to be down with the legends
E'erybody lovin' the different styles I'm reppin'
When it comes to raps, dude, y'all know I'm that dude
I'm eatin' tracks, dude, kinda like cat food
Yeah, and to the mic I'm 'bout to beeline
Eatin' tracks like cat food to a feline
I said I'm here now, I'm on the scene
But cat food ain't part o' my human cuisine
Well, then again, man, I guess it's true, the rumor
That Mack loves to eat a fresh can o' tuna
And so do cats, ayo, it's smoother than the silk
But I'm lactose intolerant, I can't drink milk
And I know cats love that (**Though most are lactose intolerant!**)
Unh, I said I'm shinin' like a hubcap
I mean a shiny fresh rim all up on the tires o' the car
Yeah, hopin' I can leave you mad inspired from the bars
Got your head noddin' when I be spittin' those flames
Tappin' in to real life, no video games
Yeah, I'm here for all o' y'all, tracks is what I stay lacin'
I remember playin' on the original PlayStation®
Back in the day, that's PlayStation One®
Before it even had numerals, was gettin' it done
Playin' Spyro™ while I was improvisin' those live flows
Off the top, check out how deep I go
And now, at the crib, I got a N64
So I be playin' GoldenEye while writin' hits for sure
I'm all up in it to win it, y'all know I be the microphone holder
I been havin' problems with my controller
Yeah, ayo, I think this shit is busted
N64 controllers with the joystick dusted
Damn, the plastic was never meant to last
This long, but you know I still get gas
When I hear the openin' song from James Bond 007
Takes me back in the day to heaven
I'm reminiscin' on before I had real responsibilities
Back when I was stretchin' with agilities
See, that's heaven to me, my old-school vision
That's heaven to me, without no religion
The old-school memories of childhood is vital
The old good times, see, that's like my Bible
Yeah, back when I was first livin' my life
Well, to me, that's even more holier than Christ
I don't have to go to church to get the god energy
All I gotta do is start diggin' through my memories
It's crazy, when I'm lookin' back in the day
And thinkin' what inspired me for rappin' this way
Yeah, I drop a verse unrehearsed and disperse through the whole universe
The studio is my church
My rhyme book is somethin' like religious text
But I'on't need to write it down just to spit 'n wreck
So I'ma come right off the top, and people know I been raw
Music is my religion, especially the improv
What!
