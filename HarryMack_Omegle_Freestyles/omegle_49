Unh, illest emcee that you heard
Unh, unh, every time that I spit, y'all know I'm fly like the birds
Ay, ay, live on Omegle, I'm here to rock for my people
Ay, flyin' way over they heads, I'm 'bout to soar like a eagle
Yeah, I'm takin' off to the sky
Ay, I'm up there way high with the clouds
Unh, stay high, turn me loud
Unh, stage dive to the crowd
Unh, yeah, they feel the way that I'm rockin'
Ay, y'all know we gettin' it poppin'
Killin' the game like I ain't got no option
'Til I be dead in my coffin, buried six feet
I'm gettin' loose on the beat
Ay, I got your head noddin' back 'n forth
Come on, bringin' the heat
Yeah, yeah, Mack off the tip o' this, y'all know I'm out here just doin' my thing
Ay, I be a bird when it comes to the lyrics, they love how I'm spreadin' my wings
Ay, I'm 'bout to soar, ay, off o' the brain
Is it a bird or a plane?
No, it's the one that leaves enemies slain
I be addictive like I was cocaine
Come off the tip o' this, my shit is major, I pull off the caper
I'm bringin' the stacks together like stapler, wait, hold up, that's paper
Unh, I let you catch it, my lyrics too reckless
Unh, y'all know I'm 'bout to go hard, I leave you bent
Ay, gettin' the money, we gettin' the paper, we gettin' right to the parchment
Unh, unh, y'all know my lyrics is dope
I blow your mind with the quotes
Ay, when I be rappin', they pullin' out paper, these rappers is all takin' notes
Yeah, I do my thing, I'm divine
Shouts out to college-ruled paper 'cause I got them lines
Ay, I leave my enemies blind
Ay, I'm out here gettin' the shine
Yeah, come off the top with the verses, I'm improvisin' all the dope hooks
With no paper and no notebook, I be leavin' haters so shook
Yeah, unh, I got the rhythm every time I get to spittin'
I be makin' people listen and I'm stayin' on my mission
And you know I got hardcore bass
Shout to my homie in the T-shirt from The North Face®
Yeah, and you know I'm 'bout to bring that off-the-head flair
Shout my homie who be noddin' with the red hair
Yeah, you know that I'm flyin' like a bird with no heavy wings
I said, "Lemme get a word," he said, "Anything?"
I said, "Maybe, but I gotta be, like, a little bit pretentious...
...'Cause I'm not gonna grab any ol' word...
...So please don't say somethin' crazy or offensive!"
He was like, "Fine, let me say 'bird'...
...Second word, I'm 'bout to say 'paper'!"
I was like, "Cool, I'm about to make a stir!"
Harry Mack, everything I drop is major
Third word, you was tryna do 'shoes'
I was like, "Enh! Sorry, you lose!...
...Used that word, like, too many times...
...But I kick it like sneakers when I'm spewin' the rhymes!"
So he had to remix it, y'all know I'm a boss
Unh, so you came up with 'dental floss'
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm really 'bout to come through With the rhymes that'll blow your mind
Word to dental floss 'cause I read between the lines
Kinda like I'm flossin'
Check the way I leave 'em, no option
Matter fact, flossin', like I got jewelry?
When it comes to lyrics, man, ain't nobody foolin' me
H-Mack, if I said it, then you know I meant this
Knock a rapper's tooth out, see a dentist
Yeah, and they really got no options
Yeah, they be braggin' 'bout they flossin'
But the problem is they ain't really got plaques, it's ironic
Ay, when it come to freestyles right off the top, man, my shit is massive, iconic
And I gotcha bouncin' and that's no doubt
Word to dental floss 'cause what's comin' out my mouth
Is clean every time, and I kick the heavy lines
Harry Mack on Omegle gettin' shine
Listen, one more time just for my homie
Ay, I leave my enemies lonely
Ay, all 'round the planet, my bars is gigantic
I guarantee they 'bout to know me
Ay, thanks for the words that you throw me
Ay, I got 'im yellin' out, "Oooh!"
Ay, I'm out here makin' them moves
Ay, your situation improves
Ay, shout to my man with his hand like this

Y'all know I've got all the lyrics they crave
If you are live with me, give me a wave

Yeah, y'all know we come with the vibe
H-Mack, I'm spittin', I'm keepin' it live
Peace to the people on YouTube who's watchin' me

I bring the vibe, I bring the passion
With all the tracks, man, I never been clashin'
You know I'm gettin' the mozzarella
The beat cut out, so I went a cappella

[[B]]
Unh, said every time I kick a rhyme, the beat gets smothered
Over tracks, I'm smooth like peanut butter
I'm buildin' like Legoland every time I spit
They hear me kick a rhyme and they sayin' I'm the shit
Yeah, when I'm on a track, yo, the beat gets smothered
Y'all know I lay it smooth like peanut butter
I build like Legoland every time I spit
When they hear me kick a verse, they like, "That dude's the shit!"
Ay, comin' off the top, my flow is dominant
I love peanut butter, that's my favorite condiment
Yeah, ayo, rappers got nothin' to tell me
Word to peanut butter, I'ma leave my enemies jelly
Yeah, comin' off the top, I be ready to slam
Speakin' o' peanut butter, yo, this here is the jam
If I ain't got a mic in my palm, I feel my hand itch
PB&J, y'all, I'm classic like the sandwich
I be comin' through and I'm 'bout to do it big
Yeah, all I ate was PB&J as a kid
Unh, every time I rhyme, I get dope in the place
I ain't like two slices, I liked it open-face'
Plus I need the bread toasted, I bragged, I boasted
'Cause I knew my mom really did it the mostest
The best PB&J this side o' town
I'd eat it in the whip when the fam would ride around
Let's go, y'all know that the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
I build like Legoland every time that I spit
When they hear me rock the jam, they like, "That dude's the shit!"
Unh, I'm on the track and the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
I build like Legoland every time that I spit
Yeah, when they hear me jam, they like, "That dude is the shit!"
Unh, got the style they beg fo', cook it up like Eggo®
Waffles, while I start to build it like LEGOs
Colossal when I'm on it, man, I do this shit so often
And my words to the beat is like LEGOs, they interlockin'
Yeah, and y'all know over tracks, my sound's racin'
I'ma build a LEGO tower on the strongest foundation
Yeah, and if you step to Mack, I'll leave you dead, boss
*tongue pop* You just a Lego Man, I take yo' head off
Mack, I make it happen, check the way that I be snappin'
I ain't never slackin', y'all know that I'm in here takin' action
Yeah, and y'all know I never linger, I prevail
Yo, I like the shade o' your pink fingernails
You got 'em painted properly, it's somethin' I enjoy
Pink just like Barbie, that's another type o' toy
But Mack is not Barbie nor LEGO, on this rap shit
I'm real flesh 'n bone and I'm never made o' plastic
Let's go, when I rock, y'all, the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
Build like Legoland every time that I spit
When they hear me rock the jam, they like, "That dude's the shit!"
Let's go, y'all know that the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
I build like Legoland every time I spit
Okay, one last verse just to prove I'm the shit
Y'all best believe me, 'cause when I rhyme, I make it look easy
I said my lyrics is the shit, yeah, my lyrics the feces
Yeah, Mack all up on it and y'all couldn't recoup
I'm reppin' my group, on the game, I be takin' a poop
Ayo, I wonder, dude, every time I spit, I drop a number two
H-Mack really the shit when I be comin' through
Y'all know when I'm on it, I'ma make it happen
Man, I'm shittin' on the industry, like, every time I'm rappin'
This is H-Mack, I be in it and I'm microphone testin'
It makes us uncomfortable but really, it's just digestion
Yeah, H-Mack, I'm 'bout to break it down scientifically
I change the game deliberately and flow exquisitely, so come and visit me
Yeah, y'all know that I'm here to bless you with raps
My lyrics move through the intestinal tract
I drop the shit on the beat, and then I start to smell the manure
Underground sounds out the sewer
Let's go, when I rock, y'all, the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
I build like Legoland every time I spit
When they hear me on the jam, they like, "That dude's the shit!"
Let's go, y'all know that the beat gets smothered
I lay it out smooth like peanut butter
Build like Legoland every time I spit
When they hear me rock the jam, they like, "Damn, he's the shit!"

[[C]]
Rappers be actin' like somehow they seein' me, trust me, man, they never seen me
I get the green when I'm all on the scene, I'ma stack it up like some zucchini
Yeah, gettin' the green like it's produce
I'm 'bout to go let this flow loose
I am the one that they won't choose to battle My voice sound like gravel
I come off the tip o' this, what could they tell me?
Word to zucchini, my lyrics is healthy
Unh, I'm never slow like a ballad
Chop up zucchini, I'm makin' a salad
Ay, I'm number one on the scene
Ay, y'all know I'm eatin' my greens
Ay, crank it up couple o' decibels
Good for your health like you eatin' some vegetables
Yeah, y'all know I'm ill
Ay, check out the way that I grab on the mic and y'all know that I'm ready to spill
Ay, cookin' these rappers like slice o' zucchini that's sittin' there all on my grill
Ay, y'all know I'm holdin' it steady but when it be comin' to bars, I'ma spill
Ay, so cold I'm givin' you chills
Come off the top o' this, heavy as anvils, I got the keys, piano
Rappers be knowin' they jealous o' Mack'n 'cause I'm goin' places they can't go
Over for rappers if you test me
You just whipped some ass up in UFC
You got on your headphones, you playin' the game
Mack off the tip, I be slayin' these lames
Unh, I'ma give you much more
And your brain is like a sponge, I'ma let it absorb
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to switch my lyrics into a piano
When it comes to that, I'ma play a complex chord
I'ma bring the harmony, I'm heavy as a armory
Whenever I be on it, I'm about to spit it hella free
So what the fuck they tellin' me?
I got the chords all up in the left hand, right hand holdin' down the melody
Matter fact, we switch it
Right hand playin' all the chords, now my left hand playin' that bassline
Unh, y'all know I be wipin' off myself with the cloth to diminish all the face shine
Video tricks for those in the mix
H-Mack, I'm about to break you off with the fix
I'm doin' what I'm feelin' and I'm really 'bout to snap
Your third word suggestion, at first, it was 'hat'
I was like, "I did that too many times...
...So for the word hat, man, I got plenty rhymes!"
Like Mack in the snapback hat
And you know I'm 'bout to drop facts
Every time I do it like this
Unh, I be all up in the mix
So I said, "For the third word, can I please get a switch?...
...Yeah, that way it'll sound fresh for the YouTube fam when I'm releasin' this shit!"
Yeah, so he done switched it to 'lamp'
Ooh, I'm shinin' bright, get you amped
Ooh, I represent for my camp
Ay, I'm 'bout to do what they can't
Ay, I shine a million watts
Ay, off top I'm spillin' these thoughts
Ay, y'all know I shine like a lighthouse
I turn your lights out
I be bright now
I make it happen, like, right now
I just be livin' my lifestyle
When it be comin' to mic styles
People be knowin' I'm quite wild
Unh, every time I spit up off the top, I do straight work
Shout to the homie with the red headset and the gold chain, rockin' in the gray shirt
What!
