Ayo, this rapper's like, "I'm nice!"
I'm like, "You ain't really hard, dude...
...You ain't even real, you remind me of a cartoon!"
So stop lyin', put that fake gat away
You remind me o' shows we used to watch on Saturday
Mornin', check the way that I'm performin', do it big
Ay, I go to beats like cartoons go to kids
Hold up, let me break it all down, you know that they cannot hate it
I'm the rappin' cartoon, I'm so animated
Ayo, I lay it down properly
I'm known for puttin' all my words together logically
And when I drop a free, never sloppily
Ayo, I'm lookin' for the paper they gon' offer me
Now, check it out, when I'm strikin'
To the greatest ever I shall be a-likened
Because I'm rollin' like a Titan
H-Mack, in this game o' rap, I'm 'bout to triumph
Titan like Titanic or Titan like a giant?
Hold up, then again, I'm 'bout to shift up every policy
'Cause I'm a fuckin' Titan like I'm outta Greek mythology
Here to get loose, check out the language I produce
I'm the Titan and I'm strikin' like the lightnin' that's from Zeus
Woah! Check the way that I'm killin' it when I'm cypherin'
Better bet my lyrics be more wetter than Poseidon
Roll with Aphrodite on the nightly, rappers wanna strike me
Greek mythology, they wanna fight me
For certain we gon' hurt emcees, I'm flexin' like I'm Hercules
I'm over heads like turbans be, I'm shocked they never heard o' me
I'm back again to rap for them, for these styles, they be thankin'
Shouts out to the girl in the black cap and the blanket
Yeah, I break it down for my people, I kick the flows that they repeated
I'm in LA, they out in Sweden
I was like, "I'm from Los Angeles, California!...
...That's my vibe, I rep that shit with pride!"
Yeah, I gotta say it like I'm proud
When I say the city that I'm from, I say it loud
Ay, I'ma kill it when I rhyme and can't nobody fuck with that
I'ma go over some heads just like your white bucket hat
Yeah, I see you noddin', do this often Harry Mack, I spit until I'm out o' breath
AKA, I'm 'bout to rhyme until the day I meet my death
Yeah, I'm never stoppin', I'm a problem
Microphone, rock it 'til the day they lay me in a coffin
Yeah, and y'all know that I'm hard, I'm the greatest
Even if I die, fuck it, I'll be reincarnated
As the greatest rapper of the future generation
So death is just another wall that I'm penetratin'
I'm innovatin', I'm improvisin' with the great stuff
Or maybe when I die, I'll decompose into space dust
And when that happens, I'll consider it a miracle
I feel I was always meant to be part of raw materials
From which we mold the future we on
Ay, when it be comin' to lyrics, y'all know that I'm comin' in strong
Listen, y'all know I'm the greatest one you ever heard, that's on my life
They were like, "Are you real? Naw, wait, say 'knife'!"
So, I said, "Knife," then I cut through like the blade
Matter fact, I'm here to show you that I'm really gettin' paid
Look, I stay fly, "Knife?" I was like, "Say it? Why?"
She was like, "I'm tryin' to assess if you are A.I."
I'm not a robot, although my flow's hot
Never been mechanical, I grip up on the mic and then I damage you
H-yeah, we be in the session, 'bout to get major soon
Add me to your watchlist, right there after Sailor Moon

[[B]]
Play me through your speakers, get your stereo hype
I build my own path, Mack is not no stereotype
Ayo, y'all know these rappers don't share no love at all
Fuck a stereotype, I'm never judging y'all
Ayo, you know I come off the top when I'm kickin' the dopest rhymes
Yeah, never be stereotypin', I'm keepin' a open mind
Yeah, y'all know that I'm doin' this for hip hop lovers
Fuck a stereotype, can't judge a book by its cover
I'ma do me forever, I come off the top, though
I'm blowin' your mind when I'm kickin' these hot flows
Yo, hold up, they ill flows Yo, hold up, they phat flows
Yo, hold up, they fly flows, they like pterodactyls
I'm over your head, ay, Mack off the top kickin' rhymes galore
Matter fact, my lyrics so old school, they be comparin' me to the dinosaurs
Yeah, every time I do it, pop on stage and the fans, they be beggin' for us
Fly like a pterodactyl, sharp like the tail of a stegosaurus
Ay, Mack off top when I do this, y'all know I'm comin' through just to flex
Ay, matter fact, they come up short, kinda like the arms all up on a T-Rex
Ay, I'ma do my thing right now when I freestyle, homie, that's the drastic part
Ay, Mack is a monster, I break out my cage in Jurassic Park
Ay, do my shit and everyone is flippin'
Ay, ay, when I kick a rhyme, I got my people trippin'
Ay, ay, give you just a taste, then I give you more
Ay, stereotype, pterodactyl; well, I explore
Ay, when I'm explorin', they be blown away from explorations
Harry Mack, I wreck your mental state with all these wet creations
I'm goin' deeper than ever, I'm droppin' mad facts
He got the fitted cap, I got the snapback
Both of 'em flipped backwards, y'all know what we all about
Anything I see and anything I hear, I call it out
Any time I'm rappin', man, I leave these rappers wasted
He said cat, dog, somethin' else, I said, "Not so basic!"
So he said, "All right, give me a second, let me come through with some better words!"
Yeah, then he hit me once again, comin' with the clever verbs
The adjectives, the adverbs and the nouns
Every time I grab the mic, I'm about to throw down
Doin' what I feel and you know that I'm a god
Peace to the homie listenin' AirPods
I can see 'em all in your ears
Every time I rhyme, you know I spit it clear
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm fully evolved
Yeah, I see the clothes hangin' on your wall
Ay, even if rappers was the clothes that's on your wall right now
They still couldn't hang with me, I'd have 'em fallin' down
Yeah, I said I spit the shit that's lethal
I make you cover your face when spittin' bars up on Omegle
For me to blow your mind, it truly is essential
You so blown away, you got your fingers on your temples

[[C]]
Mack off the top, I'ma drop another heater
Make my room like a venue, it's a theater
Can't see me losin'? Cool, I can't, either
Big shout out to your boyfriend, Peter
H-Mack, I be rockin' on the mic
What's your favorite thing about 'im? She was like, "His height?"
Yeah, y'all know he's never gonna fall, yes, y'all
Shout to Peter 'cause you know he stands tall
Yeah, you know I'ma get this done
I'm tall, too, yo, I'm six-foot-one
How tall is Peter? Better let me know
Every time I kick a lyric, they gon' sweat this flow
H-Mack with the fly poems
I'ma make these rappers die, holmes
She be filmin' on the iPhone
H-Mack, you know he is strong
Connect from LA out to Vietnam
I'ma throw it down, you know I get the golden crown
Whenever I be representin', comin' off the top and I be straight inventin'
Doin' what I'm feelin' and I'm flowin' off the head
I be sittin' in the chair, she be sittin' in the bed
Still, we connect 'cause you know I drop a ill flow
Most these other rappers, they be softer than your pillows
Do what I gotta do whenever I come off the tip
Ay, grab on the microphone and I rip, takin' you all on a trip
Do me, spit it truly, nonstop
Yeah, y'all know that we stayin' on top
Yeah, you know that I'm crushin' every beat
Okay, second word, that would be meat
H-Mack, y'all know that I never been fake
Word to meat from a cow, in the game, it's high stakes
Heh, y'all know I got them hardcore thoughts
Ay, I be eatin' instrumentals like a pork chop
Ay, check out the way that I be rippin'
Man, I really got 'em flippin', rappers scared, that's chicken
Yeah, y'all know I'ma do this the best
I'ma eat a rapper up somethin' like a chicken breast
Or a chicken wing, I'ma do my thing
Or a chicken leg, I'ma make you beg
Got liquor out the keg, getcha twisted, leave you misted
I've existed just to flip it and y'all can better fuckin' witness
Heh, and y'all know what we 'bout
H-Mack, I be gettin' loose on the scene
Meat is a big part of my cuisine
I prob'ly need to sub it out for more greens
Too much protein, not enough veggies
Yeah, that's what's gonna make me mad heavy
Yeah, right up off the brain, I flow
Plus, eatin' all the meat, it ain't sustainable
Hold up, sometimes I wonder what it's worth
Gotta let go o' the meat just to take care o' the Earth
Y'all know we can't live this way forever
When I grip up on the mic, you know I spray it clever
On this ill endeavor, I'm ready to strike
Color of your pillows, you know that it's white
Color of your wall, you know that it's white, too
Ay, every time I grab the mic, I'ma slice you
Do what I feel, ay, I'm rappin' tight
The situation's never black and white
It's somewhere in the middle, I guess it's a gray area
Mack kickin' lyrics heavy as an aircraft carrier
Breakin' every barrier, hoppin' every obstacle
Doin' the impossible, put you in the hospital
H-Mack, man, I'm rippin' them flames
E'ery time I fuckin' come, I spit off the brain
Let's go!
