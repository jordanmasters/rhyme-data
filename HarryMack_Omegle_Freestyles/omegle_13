[[A]]
Yeah, I heal your pain, I be comin' with the remedies
I dropped the beat, then they boostin' up the energy
Your whole vibe, that's what I be enhancin'
Soon as the beat plays, they start dancin'
Yeah, I keep it movin', no dummy, every day, stay sunny
I'on't even need money, I'on't really need the cash
I ain't about the flashin', ain't about the paper
I be in it for the passion
Yeah, that's the reason why I'm spillin' the flames
It ain't about the money, dawg, I'm out here killin' the game
I would do it off the top and say what I meant
Even if it never allowed me to earn one cent
Even if it never allowed me to earn one dollar
I would still drop lyrics off the top and straight holler
Over instrumentals for my people, y'all know we connectin'
When it comes to bars, I'm spittin' in all directions
Doin' what I'm feelin' and my lyrics sound tight
These other rappers get to spittin', man, I guess they aight
But see, the difference is my brain, it be shinin' so bright
I said I open up my head and then I show y'all the light
Let's do it! I'm here to rock the whole damn globe
Over my dome, yo, I got lightbulb, it's there permanently
Yeah, you know that I see ya
Light over my head, I'm havin' an idea
Mack all up in it and you know I drop my thoughts a lot
Matter fact, I shine like ten million watts
I be the light, turn it on, man, I'm hittin' the switch
Uh, rappers stayin' on some hypocrite shit
I be doin' what I'm feelin', tappin' in and buddyin'
With my people on Omegle while they steady studyin'
I'ma leave 'em shook, I steal the show like a crook
Said they studyin' and learnin' knowledge out of the books
Listen, we on the rise, check the way I improvise
I only need, like, one split-second to decide
And I be keepin' it real, I'm not about the fake stuff
Shout to my girl, red shirt and red makeup
Yeah, you know I'm rockin' the song
When I connected with them, she was drawin' it on
Yeah, ayo, I stretch out from Earth to Saturn
I dig the red makeup with the ill face pattern
Mack, I'm all up on it, I come up with rhymes with quickness
Ayo, she got the red makeup and the lipstick
It's all matched together, y'all know how it goes
Harry Mack, I'm gettin' busy when I'm kickin' the flows
Yeah, I be droppin' rhymes, y'all know I'm 'bout to smash this
Shout my girl in the pink hoodie and the glasses
Doin' what I'm feelin' man, the people know I been dope
Right behind they heads, I can see they got the windows
I come right off o' the top, about to change rap to the foulest scene
Is that makeup for Halloween?
Yeah, I'm about to do it when I flip
Ay, every time I'm rhymin', I'ma take you on a trip
I said, Is it for Halloween? I'm 'bout to run up
She said, "Yup," then she gave me the thumbs up
Call it how I see it, man, the people can't believe it
Anytime I'm rhymin', y'all know I'ma tear 'em all to pieces
Yo, you know I love to flow off the head
Ayo, in the pink hoodie, can I read what it says?
I know there's words on it but I can't really see 'em
Hold it up all up on the screen, I'ma read 'em
Yeah, ayo, they love the way that I create
Yeah, you know we choosin' love over hate
'Cause every time I'm rockin', man, I'm 'bout to drop it major
We make the decision, homie, lovers over haters
Mack all up in it and I tell you how it should be
I said I'm readin' the message off the hoodie
I'm on Omegle rockin' girls and boys
If y'all enjoyed the flow, then make some noise

[[B]]
Ay, grip on the mic and I rock it
Sipping right out o' the goblet
They say, Mack, we understandin' you
Solvin' mysteries like Nancy Drew
Come off the tip o' this, y'all know they callin' me funky fresh individual
When it be coming to lyrics, all my rhymes are harder than muhfuckin' minerals
Yeah, plug in and rock it
Ay, I'm sippin' out o' the goblet
Ay, they say, Mack, we understandin' you
Solvin' mysteries, Nancy Drew
Ay, come off the top and they they call me the funkiest rhyme individual
When it be comin' to rhymes off the top, all my lyrics are harder than minerals
C'mon, y'all can't really stop it
I be sipping liquor all up out the goblet
And you know that I'm really about to come with the rhyme smash
I might even sip it out of the wine glass
C'mon, you know that I am bout to lift 'em higher
Call me Harry Potter, that's the Goblet of Fire
Mack all up in it and I'm moving with the tactics
When it comes to rhymin' man, I'm really working magic
C'mon, you know that I don't plan the poems
Diggin' for the goblet, Indiana Jones
Comin' after mine in the Temple of Doom
Every time I'm rhymin' man, I'm fillin' up the room
Like perfume, with the boom, when I'm blowin' out the smoke
When it comes to improvisin' dog I've never been a joke
Sippin' out the goblet, you know we gettin' twisted
All up in the rhyme and you know that I'm enlisted
Yeah, sippin' it fast, you know that I smash
We gettin' the paper and cash
Every rhyme I'm that kickin' is nasty
I go to the session and leave with the stack
Ay, Mack all up in it and they wonderin'
Ay, shout out to the homie who be drummin'
Ay, I'm 'bout to leave 'em all shook
End of verse one, I'ma bring y'all the hook
Ay, plug in the mic and I rock it
Ay, I'm bout to sip out the goblet
They sayin', Mack, we understandin' you
I'm solvin' mysteries, feelin' like Nancy Drew
Ooo, come off the top when I'm spittin, the funkiest rhyme individual
Ay, all of these rhymes that I kick off the top, they be harder than minerals
Put words together so exquisitely
Nancy Drew, I'ma solve the mystery
Yeah, they be blind, I'm the rapper that you can't see
Rolling with my queen and I think her name is Nancy
Yeah, she be lookin' fine, she a dime
I be improvisin' live when I'm kickin all the rhymes
I be getting down with my man, who be doin' covers
Nancy Drew, she my fly ass lover
Ay, Mack rollin' through, leave ya shook
My girl so fine she could probably can write a book
My girl so fine, they gon' probably write about her
Every time I'm rollin' out with her, I feel prouder
Shouts out to Nancy, shouts out to Drew
I be representin' live, comin' through with my crew
When I'm spreading like the flu
Man I'm way too fucking contagious
With bars, it's outrageous
Ay, plug in and rock it
Look, I'm bout to sip out the goblet
Ay, they say Mack, we understandin' you
Solvin' the mystery, Nancy Drew
Ay, when it be comin' to rhymin' I be the funkiest individual
Ay, when it be comin' to rhymes off the top, I be harder than minerals
Listen, you know that my lyrics sound fatal
Minerals, kinda like the periodic table
Yeah, you know I'm about to do it nonstop
I be like a mineral 'cause that's the way I rock
Harry Mack, I'm about to hit them with the verse
I disperse, huh, unrehearsed, through the universe
Y'all know they about to dig deep in the earth just to find me
Mack, I be staying on a rhyme spree
Kinda like mineral, you know that I be shiny
Every time I am on it man, I am like wassup guy, we
Really 'bout to lock in
They ain't got no option
When the beat droppin'
I'ma keep it goin' acapella
When I chop a fella into little bits
Harry Mack, when I come right of the top with the spit
Getting down with my man, I'm the world's 8th wonder
I got rhythm when I'm rhymin', kinda like a drummer

[[C]]
C'mon, I go over heads, ay, kinda like bandana
Ay, peelin' lyrics off the top, kinda like banana
Ay, every time I bust frees, y'all know they like plushie
Rappers turnin' soft, I make 'em blue it's what I do
I said I'm goin' over heads, y'all, kinda like bandana
Peelin' lyrics off the head, y'all, kinda like banana
I said every time I bust frees, rappers soft like plushie
Yeah, I'm 'bout to flow off the head
Leavin' 'em blue, this is Code Red
Ay, come off the tip when I'm rappin'
You know that I be the room scanner
Y'all know I'm peelin' open my brain
Kinda like I'm openin' a banana
Y'all know I'm droppin' the rhymes that they couldn't compute
Shout to bananas, I eat 'em like fruit
Harry Mack, even from distance, I reach this
Lovin' bananas and lovin' some peaches
Every time I spit, they sayin', "You raw, Harry"
I bring more juice than a strawberry
Y'all know I'm doin' it truly
I mixed the banana with berries for smoothie
Put it together, this flow, you remember
You know that I'm stirrin' it up in the blender
It's Harry Mack, I be the time and space transcender
With lyrics up on my agenda, let's go!
Ay, I go over heads and I be that bandana
Ay, peelin' lyrics off o' the dome like banana
They be callin' me the room scanner
Ay, can't nobody do what I do
Every time I kick a lyric off the top, it's true
And you know I got my competitors feelin' real sad
Yeah, got 'em all feelin' real blue, come on!
When I be spittin', yo, truly it's fly
Blue like the ocean, blue like the sky
Uh, blue like my favorite color
Y'all know I'm leavin' the track so smothered
Come off the top when I bust free
I'ma kill the game, everybody better trust me
Every time I rhyme off the top, man, you know I'm a boss
All these other rappers soft like plushies
Yeah, grip on the mic and I damage you
Ay, I'm like the rhymin' stuffed animal
Ay, but I am never no toy
Come off the top with the rhymes you enjoy
Yeah, you know it's never gonna end
Time and space, couple things I transcend
Shout out to my brand new people on Omegle
I ask them what they doin', they said we be makin' friends


[[D]]
Ay, situation is Code Red, god
Soon as the beat drops, he brings the head nod
Mack all up on it, man, my lyrics have been true
He said, I'm a rapper, too, spittin' in Hindu
Yeah, I'm fillin' enemies up with anguish
My man, he be rappin' in his native language
You know I'm about to come and injure ya
I get love from the people outta India
Now let me break it down for all o' y'all
I cut through like a knife
You steppin' incorrect to Mack, I might just end your life
I'm doin' what I'm feelin' 'cause my flow is unforgivin'
Break out the mental prison, hip hop is how I'm livin'
It's teachin' me 'bout life, so I'm studyin' the lyrics
Every time I'm rhymin', I be liftin' up your spirit
They talkin' shit up on my name but I don't wanna hear it
I get you high like you pack it, light it, then you clear it
Yeah, I'm lastin' forever, I do my thing
To my lyrics, they cling, y'all know I shine like the bling
I said I'm here in the session, teaching y'all a lesson
When it comes to rhymes, man, I'm oh-so impressin'
No distractions, rep my faction, takin' action
Live on Omegle for the interaction
We comin' together and my flow is absurd
We interactin' on Omegle 'cause you throwin' me words
Ain't another rapper like me, ay, positivity in my psyche
Ay, I just do it like Nike, ay, from a distance, they wanna strike me
Ayo, y'all know that the freestyle game really proud o' us
Ayo, my psyche, y'all could never cloud it up
I don't accept negativity, y'all know when I'm spittin' free
Showin' creativity, takin' hella liberties, livin' so exquisitely
Homie, I deliberately changed the game eternally
There ain't no rapper burnin' me, I'm who they wanna learn to be
But they are not concernin' me
'Cause y'all know I been workin' hard, that's for certain, god
Yeah, he got the head nod and it's still goin' strong
I'm movin' through your words, homie, follow along
Ay, everything that I bring is pure
Spittin' fire, so go grab the extinguisher
Yeah, you know that I'm off-top with the creations
Somebody dial 9-1-1, "Fire station!...
...We gon' need you to come with the truck and the hose...
...'Cause this dude is startin' fires with his freestyle flows...
...Nah, ayo, the address, I don't even know...
...It's on Omegle, dawg, but he turned it into a show!"
Hang up, ayo, 9-1-1 can't save the day
Y'all know I'm burnin' through the screen in a major way
I make it happen when I'm on it, if I said it, then I meant it
Y'all know I'ma change the game forever like I'm Kendrick
Yeah, I stay hot, rappers should lay off
I'm 'bout to drop some classic records like I'm K-Dot
Uh, and you know my lyrics mad gritty
Shout to Kendrick, the good kid out the m.A.A.d city
Yeah, ayo, I do it unlike all o' these other guys
I'ma teach you how to pimp a butterfly
Smother my instrumentals when I'm on it, y'all know I'ma slam
I rap, then Kendrick album: DAMN.
That's the only reaction from the live interaction
Instrumentals I'm smackin', dawg, I'm really gettin' down
So he do like this with his hand
H-Mack on Omegle, came to spit for the fam
