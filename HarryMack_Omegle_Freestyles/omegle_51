Before I kick a rhyme, y'all better get ready first
H-Mack goin' on a journey through the metaverse
Hundred M-P-H all up on my dashboard
Cuttin' like the scissors, that's the reason that I rap for
Unh, 'fore I kick a rhyme, y'all better get ready first
Ay, I'ma take you on a journey through the metaverse
Ay, hundred M-P-H all up on the dashboard
Cuttin' through these tracks like scissors, dawg, that's what I rap for
Unh, yeah, every time I rhyme, it's off the noodle
I was like, "Metaverse? Wait, let's search that up on Google..."
Yeah, 'cause y'all know, Harry Mack, I rep my 'vision
But before I rap about it, I'ma need a definition
So, straight to Google, that's where I'ma go
Come to find ‘metaverse’ a portmanteau
It's two different words smashed together and combined
Now, I can incorporate it in my rhyme
Yeah, portmanteau, kinda like brunch
That's when you combine breakfast and lunch
In this case, we combined the word ‘meta’
With ‘universe’, now it sounds much better
Metaverse, yeah, and let me tell y'all what it is
Unh, Harry Mack, I be rhymin' in this record biz
But I do live streams all up in the VR
I enter the metaverse while I kick these sweet bars
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, I rhyme off the top with passion
I'm all up in the VR space with people, interactin'
Yeah, I'm snappin', I can see your avatar
They be like, "Who's this dude that's rappin' hard with massive bars?...
...Yo, that's the Mack'n star, dude that's up on YouTube...
...Yeah, he's got some videos, I think he's got a few views!"
Unh, H-Mack, I'm live up in the place
On my dashboard, I got, like, one hundred M-P-H
Yeah, my styles devour
Matter fact, now it's hundred twenty miles per hour
I got no time to kick it with these lying cowards
I'm 'bout to push the pedal
On down to the metal 'cause I'm never gonna settle
Harry Mack, I'm goin' faster
Causin' a fuckin' disaster
Check my dashboard, see how fast I'm goin'
Check out the way that I'm flowin'
Unh, I'm about to cut you up
Got the man mouthin', "What the fuck?!"
Yeah, can't believe what I'm sayin' Y'all know I rep for the fly guy
He be rockin' the sweater from Vans® I can see the colors are tie-dye
H-Mack, they lovin' the rap sound I'ma make a wack clown have to back down
Yeah, and you know I'm so fast, in a hurry My words is blurry like your background
Unh, H-Mack, I be bringin' it together
When it come to rhymes, I'm much better
Tougher than leather when on the endeavor
I got you noddin', I do this often, I keep on rockin'
Unh, I be paintin' y'all a picture
Cuttin' through the instrumental like a pair o' scissors
Yeah, we line it up from bottom to the top
Ay, rappers pull the scissors so I'ma pull the rock
Unh, gettin' to the paper, slayin' these lames
I cover up the tracks but I ain't playin' no games
Unh, yeah, ah, 'fore I kick a bar, I best get ready first
I'm about to take you on a journey through the metaverse
Ay, hundred miles per hour on the dashboard
Cuttin' through these tracks like scissors, dawg, that's what I rap for
'Fore I kick a rap, ay, y'all better get ready first
I'm about to take you on a journey through the metaverse
Unh, hundred miles per hour all up on the dashboard
Cuttin' through these wack rappers, dawg, that's what I spaz for

[[B]]
Everybody knows my style is greater
My brain is more advanced than a calculator
Unh, and I always be awesome
The mental calculator live-solvin' the problem
Yeah, there's no equation that my mind can't figure out
Rappers always findin' somethin' new to bicker 'bout
But not the Mack'n, I'm attackin' any problem
I get to the answer by droppin' rap stanzas
Yeah, and y'all know I be one-two-one-two-testin'
Then again, I have fewer answers than questions
Always good to ask, I'm expandin' my mind
Makin' all these rappers throw tantrums in time
Yeah, droppin' anthems on the drop of a dime
I'm rockin' it prime 'n often I shine
I'm doin' my thing, I'm the number-one runner
Unh, typin' in my calculator different numbers
That's the way I'm livin', I spit it, my shit is not simplistic
Like I got advanced TI-89 with mad digits
Unh, the cypher session what I go ham in
My flow slammin', I got calculators for programmin'
I'm goin' in once again, y'all know that my flow's up
Over beats, I'm soundin' sweeter than some doughnuts
Yeah, and Harry Mack, y'all know I'm leavin' you amazed
Turn your eyes to doughnuts, I got 'em glazed
You can't believe it, ayo, so turn me up louder
Like the sugar on a doughnut, crushin' rappers to powder
Yeah, I'm 'bout to win again Got 'em tremblin', colder than the winter wind
I like the doughnuts that's dipped in the cinnamon
I got more synonyms: for dope, cool; cool, awesome; dope, ill
Once again, I spill, I came through to build
Yeah, ayo, I run through the thesaurus
I'm the type o' rapper that you never gettin' bored with
Hold up, I got the flows they lovin', hotter than a oven
I go one above the average, somethin' like a baker's dozen
That be 13, I get the loosest with on the word scene
Turn me up louder, I bet you your neighbors heard me
Unh, I'm 'bout to linger and prevail, never fail
Yeah, lookin' pretty like your long fingernails
It's Harry Mack, I call it out, I do it off the mental
So I need no utensil, not a pen nor a pencil
Unh, so please tell me what you gonna do
Like lead up in the pencil, Mack gon' take a number 2
Up on the game, I'm shittin' on these rappers, spit 'n cause disaster
Y'all know they don't get it half the time
I'm 'bout to hit the plaster with a rhymer's blood, I rise above
No one can do this type o' stuff, so they idolizin' us
H-Mack, I'm improvisin' stuff You thought you had to stop to write 'n stuff
I just bust, I have crushed all my competition
Mack ain't never slippin', y'all, I'm stayin' on the mission
This instrumental, I'ma kill it off the head
I don't talk o' pencil when I fill it up with lead
H-Mack, my mind's the nine, yes, my mental is the gat
Unh, I'm about to snap; people, tell me where ya at
Unh, turn me up much louder, I'ma blow your speakers
Peace to the people that's bumpin' me out in Costa Rica
H-Mack, I'm on it, I'ma stay up on my path
You got calculator 'cause you procrastinatin' on math
Hold up, I said, y'all know I'ma tell it through rap
Oh, you procrastinatin'? Hold up, let me help you with that!
Yeah, I'ma kick a rhyme and do it off the mind
And somethin' like the pearl on your necklace, I'ma shine
It's H-Mack, y'all know that we 'bout to get it done
How many pearls are we seein', currently it's one
Well, Mack is number one at the top o' the list
So give me one minute so I can start rockin' this shit
Ayo, one-on-one battle, Harry Mack 'bout to win
It's the one-on-one interaction on Omegle with friends
Ayo, one time for the beat, one time for the lyric
One time for the people who be spittin' from the spirit
I'm goin' a cappella and the flow's divine
One more line so Mack can really blow your mind

I always thought they mixed it with the strawberries after
It turns out, it's not always what you think
Strawberry cows out in the field, they lookin' pink
They be rollin' with the regular cows but they be laughin'
'Cause they like, "Check out my skin," I got a passion
For the pink vibe I'm on when I ride the song
I never write it down, I improvise the song
Yeah, ayo, I'm here to get loose, check out the lyrics I produce
Word to cows with the strawberry juice
I get it milky and creamy, they never see me, believe me

Doin' it there for whenever I be deliverin' this off-the-head flair
Shout to the homie who's watchin' me with they hood up over the red hair
