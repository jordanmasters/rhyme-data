Every time I rhyme, you know I don't plan stuff
Turn it to a show, I'ma make you throw your hands up
Mack all up in it and I blow your mind when I kick a bomb verse
I'ma turn Omegle to a concert
Yeah, I'ma make your jaws hit the ground
H-Mack comin' too raw with the sound
Ay, I got the lyrics they mention
I'm hopin' the both o' y'all payin' attention
I come off the tip showin' these rappers out there in the game how it should be
Booty, dick, pussy, that's all one word, it's budussy
Unh, I get it gushy, all o' my lyrics is wet
When it be comin' to bars, I be pressin' a threat
I'm doin' shit they ain't done yet
Yeah, when it come to lyrics, ain't nobody goin' past me
Rap about budussy, we 'bout to get nasty
Mack, when I'm on it, I be ready with the flex
Droppin' more lyrical text that feels better than sex
Unh, feelin' better than the intercourse
Over instrumentals we about to scorch
I'm fancy like a Porsche or a BMW
Comin' with the lyrics that are guaranteed to trouble you
Lookin' to 'er friend like, "This dude's good!"
They like, "Yeah, I ain't understood..."
Mack off the top, they be talkin' with the commentary
Really, though, there ain't nobody as bomb as Harry
I'm about to break it down, can't nobody fuck with that
I be hangin' kinda like your background with that blue bucket hat
I ain't goin' nowhere so you're stuck with Mack
I be all up on it, I can call what I see
All these other emcees seemin' faulty to me
I come off the tip and I'm goin' where they can't go
When it come to lyrics, I get juicy as a mango
Unh, I got the bars you can't compute, I be gettin' to the loot
Yo, mango, that's a fruit
And I love it 'cause I gotta get the fruits and the veggies
When it come to lyrics, I be truly heavy, way too deadly
Unh, I make you turn your hand into a fist
Unh, I can tell you diggin' the way that I'm rhymin' when you start to dance like this
H-Mack, man, I'm comin' up next
Lookin' like you in the gym, you about to flex
Unh, H-Mack, comin' through, I be runnin' you up outta town
You got the muscles, rappers are in trouble
Yeah! Go on, show 'em them guns!
Unh, we about to get it done
H-yeah, you be flexin' like Arnold
H-yeah, we be out here havin' fun
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm spittin' great
Yo, speakin' of Arnold, participate
'Cause when it comes to freestyles, I'm the problem solver
I blend different flavors, Arnold Palmer
H-Mack, y'all know they ain't nice like me
We got the lemonade and the ice-ass tea
H-Mack, y'all know I'ma rip it with no plan
Shout to the girl who be sippin' on the can
Got the Arnold Palmer like we playin' golf
I'ma hit the hole-in-one, now the problem solved
Yeah, rappers steppin' up, they gettin' violated
Go and sip that can, you gotta get hydrated
Every time I'm rhymin', man, I got the people sweatin'
When it comes to bars, I'ma leave these rappers threatened
I got you relaxin' kinda like a wine glass
Rappers playin' games but I ain't with the Minecraft
Unh, I'm havin' fun with frees
Playin' Minecraft, I'm out here punchin' trees
Yeah, matter fact, I get ill, no doubt
When I'm done punchin' the tree, I'm buildin' a house
Yeah, I got a full-ass day, after that, I'll be rhymin'
I punched through a tree, I built me a house, and now I'm diggin' deep, I'm minin'
Yeah, H-Mack, I be slayin' them lames
Minecraft, but I'm never playin' no games
Got you dancin', got you vibin', I'm arrivin'
H-Mack steady improvisin'
Bright like the sun shinin' at the horizon in the mornin'
Check out the way I'm performin', no warnin'
Comin' off the top and I'm more than live
On the back wall, you got the 45s
I can see the records hangin' up
Instrumentals, I'ma bang 'em up
Yeah, and y'all know my freestyle don't end
You're pullin' out your phone just to text to your friends
Like, "We on Omegle right now and this guy...
...Is really soundin' dope while he starts to improvise!"
Yeah, you know that I'm 'bout to amaze my
New friends while you show me on the FaceTime
Yeah, and I demonstrate the stamina
For the person on the other side o' the camera
Yeah, I get loose with the flow
You be watchin' me on camera and you be sayin', "Whoa..."
They can't believe what they seein'
I'm nonstop with the freein'
I am not from Earth, I'm a alien
I am not a human bein'
Y'all know we came to get live
Other emcees, they will not survive
Punchin' through a tree, build a house, then we minin'
Y'all know we be up on Omegle gettin' live

[[B]]
Plug in the mic and I'm ready to rock
They feel my vibe from the bottom to top
Once we get started, we never gon' stop
All o' my lyrics is funky like socks
Yeah, all o' these rappers, they been trash
Smellin' like socks after gym class
H-yeah, that means they reekin'
Check out the way that I'm speakin', I got you all tweakin'
Unh, when I be rappin', they knowin' I'm good
Ay, I'm goin' over these beats like a sock goin' over yo' foot
Yeah, when I be rockin', they be knowin' I'm locked in, 'cause I do this so often
Rappers is not that bad, unh, they don't get coal in they stockin's
Mack, y'all know I'm really 'bout to kill it
All my flows hotter than a skillet
Right from the bottom, Harry Mack is 'bout to build it
I'm so cold and my freestyle's chilly
Yeah, yeah, make you stand out o' your chair
Unh, lit in the street like a flare
Ay, 'bout 'em, I don't even care
Ay, doin' my thing and I'm deep in the mo'fuckin' zone
Ay, soon as I start with the rhymes, pullin' out your phone
Yeah, you gotta film it for sho'
Ay, lettin', like, all your friends know
Ay, plantin' the seed in the soil
Ay, they we be watchin' it grow
Ay, ay, comin' right up off the top, change the game, I be more prone
Matter fact, tappin' in like Morse code
One day, I'ma be at 'at award show
I'ma turn hip hop to a war zone
H-Mack, man, y'all know that when I rhyme, they be knowin' it's the illest, scary
Freestyle tactics: runnin' in, no camo, lyric ammo, military
One-man army, all o' my lyrics, they be heavy as a tank
Unh, everything I spit sound dank
Unh, gettin' to the money, that bank
Ay, stackin' the cash
Ay, I got more weed in the stash
Ay, but I ain't smokin' no mo'
Ay, had to say no
Unh, shit, it had me way too paranoid
But now I just destroy
Any track that I hop on
Block your mind when I spit flames
Turn this track to a hot song
Yeah, come off the tip and they lovin' the way that I'm rockin' it
I'm like the summer sun, I'ma melt a rapper down like chocolate
Whoa, I know they heard me
Eatin' the chocolate, I'm eatin' the Hershey's
Ay, y'all know I'm crushin' this beat
Somethin' like chocolate, my lyrics too sweet
Yeah, you know that he's strong
Shout to homie with hair and the bleach-blond
Mack, y'all know I'm gettin' it done
My heart and my soul where I'm spittin' it from
Unh, I do off-the-head work
One's in the blue and one's in the red shirt
H-Mack, I be callin' out the outfits
Other emcees, man, they not really about shit
When I popped up, they like, "You a YouTuber?...
...We can tell you look good on your computer!"
H-Mack, comin' with the freestyle lyrics
You know I'm deliverin' directly from the future
Killin' it, I got you laughin' when I'm spittin' with a passion
Me and tracks are never clashin', I'ma really make it happen
It's the Mack'n, never slackin'
I'm not sittin' on no couch, I'm lettin' more lyrics fall up out my mouth when I'm goin' double time
I'ma blow your mind with a nonsubtle rhyme
H-Mack in it and I push it to the end
Blessed to be locked in with my news friends

...give a quick shout to our sponsor
Off top, I be the lyrical monster
But when it comes to travel, believe me, friends
You gonna wanna know 'bout NordVPN®
Now, look, I know what you're thinkin'
"What's happenin'? Bring it back again...
...Yo, Mack, man, what's a VPN havin' to do with travelin'?"
Well, here's a fact that will entice you the quickest
Usin' Nord, you can get a cheaper price on your tickets
So if it's flights that you pickin', or trains that you bookin'
You unsatisfied with the offers they gave you in Brooklyn
Maybe you should change your location to Spain and keep lookin'
They may have some crazy-cheap vacation rates that they pushin'
Man, who knows? But before your final trip gets chose
You may as well use Nord to virtually travel the globe
Wait, usin' virtual travel to help plan your real-world travel?
Whoa, my brain starts to unravel
But if we talkin' icebergs, that's just the tip, my G
Let me paint a picture quick, come get with me
Let's say you binge-watchin' a show religiously
But then you gotta dip on a business trip and leave
Eleven hours on the plane, unh, sittin' hella patient
Contemplatin' the show 'til you hit your destination
Pull out Netflix®, now you wanna jump out your skin
Come to find the show's blocked in this country you're in
Nooo! See, this is how a knife to the throat would feel
The local shows just don't appeal
Well, don't worry! See, Nord lets you change your whole zone for real
To bring the comfort of a home-cooked meal
That's metaphorically speakin', they don't cook like your momma
But they got access to the comedies, sci-fis and dramas
Not to mention sportin' events you dyin' to see
Might even let you watch for free instead of buyin' with fees
But, yo, don't take it from me... Wait, no, hold up, you should!
'Cause we got a deal in the description, trust me, it's good
Seventy-three percent off, four months free, not bad
Now look, please don't get mad, this ain't no regular ad
See, this advantageous add-on for your adventures
Helps you adapt when addicting shows are censored
All I'm tryna say is Nord's reppin' for the people hard
All right, cool, let's get back to these Omegle bars

[[D]]
My style, you better cherish this
Most these rappers an embarrassment
I be gettin' to the green, shouts out to asparagus
Mack, if I grip up on the mic, you know I'm testing you
Always eat asparagus, obsessed with the vegetables
Yeah, when I'm on the mic, y'all know I'm doin' work
Gotta eat your asparagus before you have your dessert
That's what my momma used to say, I was in a high dream
Thinkin' maybe I could skip asparagus to ice cream
Let me rearrange the order, peace to my supporters
I light the track on fire, check the way that Mack can scorch ya
Yeah, I cut the flow loose
Asparagus, I'm organic like the produce
Ayo, I'm the one they choose when I'm in it 'cause my rhymes too infinite
And I step to the plate 'cause I never been timid
When they hear how I rhyme, they like, "Naw, this dude is too raw!"
Matter fact, they feel me all the way in Utah
Ayo, I'ma build it, I don't need no LEGOs
You was like, "I took a trip to Cali, down to San Diego!"
"Oh, word? I'm in LA so that's not even far!"
I got your jaw droppin' every time I'm rockin' these bars
Somethin' different when I'm in it, man, y'all know I get it live
Rule #1: Never Omegle and drive!
Yeah, I'm glad you pulled to the side, I'm 'bout to spark a lot
O' lyrics while you listenin' in your car in the parkin' lot
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm really on a mission
In fact, I make these rappers, who are supposedly "driven"
Switch they transmission into the Park position
Yeah, otherwise, they crash, I cause a collision
Yo, I'm back up on it, Harry Mack, yo, I bus' a flow
I'm the one you heard, like a large pack o' buffalo
Unh, I'm up in it and I got just what you need
Ay, I run y'all over like a buffalo stampede
Unh, they say the lyrics that I'm kickin' soundin' strange
Ay, your style's used, like from Buffalo Exchange
Ay, Mack on another plane, I keep it movin' constantly
Yeah, rappers imitate my style, they some wannabes
I go wild, I stretch for miles, since I was a child
You know I kick the lyrics, they in my file
So go and pull them out the manila folder
I'm iller, I thought that I told ya
The lyrical builder who's here from the soul, bruh
I'm exposin' more lyrics for my fans
Hear the way I'm rockin' on these jams
I keep it movin' in a true, fresh way
I'm representin' rappers from the USA
Unh, told ya I embarrass ya, they like, "Mack, we cherish ya!...
...The illest rapper in the United States of America!"
H-yeah, and it says "the united"
But at times, I look around, it seems like they're divided
Yeah, so many different views within this country
Yeah, sometimes it makes you wanna jump without the bungee
But never that, 'cause we gon' keep on persistin'
Told you I'm causin' collisions when I be spittin', I'm all on my mission
You know that I'm gettin' it done forever whenever I'm rappin', I make you feel mellow
Shouts out to the homie in the light blue and yellow
Yeah, I'm 'bout to blow up and you expect this
I see you chewin' on the gum, and you got the necklace
Yeah, in the front seat o' the car
Hopped on Omegle, now you're listenin' to my bars
Rock for the people and I'm glistenin', a star
Up in the night sky
They hearin' me rap and they know I'm that hype guy
I wave my hand around all crazy every time I spit
My fans call me out for this, I prob'ly need to quit
Yeah, it's H-Mack, check the way that I'm bustin'
With freestylin', got ya smilin' while the game's adjustin'
Like that!
