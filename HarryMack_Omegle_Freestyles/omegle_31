When I'm rappin', I be crackin' through the surface
Lovin' life even though it's imperfect
Even on the days when I'm feelin' nervous
Even on the days when I'm feelin' scared
Feelin' like I'm not ready, like I'm not prepared
Yeah, I'm not perfect, I'm nothin' but a human
And sometimes the fear is so all-consumin'
Yeah, those voices be in my ear boomin'
Yeah, it feels like I can't find no room in this world just to be myself
Imperfect when dealin' with my mental health
Imperfect 'cause y'all know that I make mistakes
But I keep it real, y'all know that I'm never fake
I'm gettin' better on the daily
Even when the anxiety drive me crazy
I just get up out the bed 'cause I never been lazy
One foot in front o' the other, that's the way we recover
Even when it feels like we are straight gettin' smothered
I'ma lift the weight off o' my shoulders and keep goin'
Lift the weight off o' my shoulders and keep flowin'
Live for my people when I'm locked in on Omegle
I'ma kill the beat whenever I'm rappin', my flow is lethal
Let's go! I'm spittin' fire just to lift you higher
I'm comin' with the bars they certain to admire
Yeah, and y'all know that we risin' above
I swear to god I got the lyrics, people fallin' in love
Yeah, soon as they hear 'em
Ay, I be shinin' kinda like a diamond earrin'
Yeah, I just open up my path, move to the clearin'
Yeah, 'cause I know that one day I'll be disappearin'
Ay, I gotta do it now, take advantage of the moment
All o' my skill, man, you know I gotta hone it
Yeah, when it comes to these lyrics, I be entirely free
And all around the planet, these people admirin' me
'Cause I go wild with ease, get loose over tracks
Yeah, they can do it well but they can't do it like Mack
Every time that I rhyme, man, I truly bring it back
Ay, check what we all about, I'm spittin' on the mic
And I'm tryna figure out how I can navigate this life
Yeah, and when it comes to rhymin', y'all know I'ma go in
You're tryin' to speak about your life in the poem
You are like, I'm stuck right now, it seems absurd
"'Bits of life'—can you try to help me find a word?"
Yeah, ayo, you know this flow is my illest component
Bits o' life, we livin' all throughout these moments
Yeah, ain't it crazy when lookin' back?
All the different memories that lead up and stack
To this very moment where we at in the present
Every time I'm rhymin', I let you in on my essence
Yeah, and y'all know when I'm rappin' they gon' go mad
She was like, "Could you please help me with the vocab?"
Come off the top and I flow with ease, I kick the lyrical poetry
Harry Mack, I be goin' in, runnin' off-top and I'm dope for them
Better be knowin' whenever I'm flowin', I puttin' 'em up on the game

All o' my lyrics—hold u', hold u'
I said I spit what I think
Chain only as strong as the weakest link
Life here and gone, you gon' miss it if you blink
Shit is so crazy, I might have to see a shrink
Ay, tell me what to think, ay, ay, ay, ay
'Cause the chain only strong as the weakest link in it
All my bars are infinite
When I'm rhymin', I be climbin' and ya know I gotta do it
I be shinin' like a chain every time I kick the fluid
Let's go! Rappers, I'ma challenge them
My bars heavy like a big-ass medallion
Yeah, I be shinin' each and every time that I bust it
Somethin' like a chain when it's diamond-encrusted, flooded
Y'all know they never really foolin' me
Rappers ain't schoolin' me, motherfuck the jewelry
'Cause I'on't need a chain, I shine from the mental
No pen or pencil, I never trace a stencil

[[C]]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' it, no debate
When I rhyme, I keep y'all up late
When it come to the freestyle lyrics
They be sayin' that I'm awesome, wonderful and great
Yeah, I be rhymin' off top
What's the reason for that? 'Cause I can't sing
They said, "Awesome, wonderful, great."
I said, "Nah, those all mean the same thing."
Hold up, we still 'bout to get it done
But we 'bout to combine all three as one
Harry Mack, comin' off the top real quick
When it come to freestyles, man, I drop real sick
I'm about to hit ya every time I paint a picture
Man, you know I stay up in it and my lyrics never timid
When it come to freestyles, man, they love how I perform
Word is born right up off the top, I'm 'bout to keep you warm
Matter fact, more than warm, I spit hot
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm movin' with the plot

Yeah, Mack is the moniker
'Bout to blast through your thermometer
Way too hot, yo, my purpose get it done
Way too hot like the surface of the sun
Way too hot like the solar, mic controller, thought I told ya
At the same time it's ironic cause my bar's colder than polar bear
Hit you with the solar flare
Oh, we goin' there through the open air
I'll be throwin' out my lyrics And I do it from the spirit
When it come to lyricism, homie, can't nobody touch me
All these other rappers, they be soft, they lookin' like a plushie
Every time I grip up on the mic, I'm 'bout to damage you
I told you they be soft just like a plushie, stuffed animal
Harry Mack, I'm all up in it, I'm about to spin it all around
Like a merry-go, they listenin' when Harry flow
Rhymes, I'll be up to the freakin' task
You ain't gotta ask, I dig both of your masks
I'm comin' off the top and kickin' rhymes galore
They got the green masks lookin' like some dinosaurs
Ay, all of my lyrics is colder than blizzard
The mic is my wand, I'm a mo'fuckin' wizard
And y'all know whenever I'm kickin' my rhymes
