[[A]]
I make you understand, I do my rhymes without a plan
When it comes to freestylin', Harry Mack is the man
When I'm finished with these lyrics, yo, the mic what I slam
I be blendin' many colors like I'm drawin' with crayons
Unh, rappers get they records spawned, do the payola
More colors in my mind than the box o' Crayola®
That's the 64, I'm goin' harder with the raps
I'm talkin' 'bout the big box with the sharpener on the back
These are facts, all these other rappers really slack
Word to crayons 'cause these verses, you could press 'em to wax
Yeah, all these rappers, you can tell that they clowns
They like crayons left outside in the summer: meltin' 'em down
Yeah, it's nothin' subtle, all you rappers in trouble, grow like my stubble
Rappers crayons, I'm 'bout to melt 'em to puddles
I'm doin' me, puttin' words together and I'm snappin' on all my haters
I be gettin' green like the color of a alligator
Ayo, they love the way I rock the style
Swimmin' deep like alligators and crocodiles
H-Mack, man, I'm gettin' to the loot
On some Mack shit, I should rock some alligator boots
Got the crocodile leather, y'all know I'm doin' better
I stay on my endeavor and my verses way too clever
Yeah, Harry Mack, I rearrange while I smother
Like the lights in your room, my rhymes be changin' colors
Yeah, I'm on another plane, y'all know my flow is major
When I popped up, they was like, "Can tell you a content creator!"
No doubt, yo, that's a fact, that's the reason I get props
He's like, "We about to be in a viral vid up on TikTok®...
...I can tell!" I told 'im, "One step at a time...
...First gimme three words, I'll start wreckin' my rhymes!"
I'm doin' me whenever I'm on it, I spit with lots o' soul
I said I melt 'em like crayons? I'll melt 'em like a popsicle!
Do the impossible, I leave mics up in smoke
Yeah, rappers kinda like popsicle stick jokes
Meanin' when they rappin', there's no way they'll outperform me
They predictable like popsicle stick jokes, they corny
Yeah, I break it down and I be keepin' it real
My passion, I start eatin' and then it's revealed
Yeah, like the stick with the joke, givin' y'all the punchline
Whenever I'm rockin' right off o' the top o' the dome, we havin' a fun time
I be doin' me, rhymin' fluidly and I never stop, I am so absurd
Shouts out to the homie on the side with that made-up word
Yeah, every time I spit, y'all know they 'bout to listen very
Deep because I travel from the mind, I'm expeditionary
Yeah, I keep spittin' 'til my final breath o' livin'
Expeditionary, I just gave your word a definition
Take you on a expedition, when I wreck, you listen
I be on a treacherous mission when I spit with this vision
Yeah, and y'all know in the game, we 'bout to run this
I'm on a expedition, but no Christopher Columbus
Yeah, 'cause I would rather go deep, get creative
And fuck Christopher Columbus for slayin' all them Natives
He's a hater, everything we drop off the top is major
I be the rhyme innovator, ill freestyle creator
And every time I come off the tip o' the dome Y'all know that I'm gettin' too mean with the raps
Shout to the homie who be on the side in the gamin' chair just leanin' back
Yeah, I'm doin' everything I'm feelin'
Rhymes I deliver, they be one in a million
I get loose when I'm up in the house
You got a pile o' clothes back there on your couch
H-Mack, I'm in the buildin' so tell me how you feelin'
I'm shinin' brilliant, my verses are one in a million
Now listen, these skills I deliver, y'all can tell they viral
So what you think, if we post this on TikTok®, will we go viral?

[[B]]
Turn me up loud, they gon' get the vibe
Unh, your brain's what I get inside
Unh, just like I'm swingin' the clock
Ay, I leave you hypnotized
Yeah, you know I always am heat
Hypnotize y'all, got you fallin' asleep
Yeah, y'all know my flow is divine
I hypnotize rappers, take over they minds
Yeah, Mack, I be all up on it
Ay, when I rhyme, I be workin' that magic
Unh, and you know that I hypnotize
Hold up, wait a minute, that's a Biggie Smalls classic
Ay, H-Mack, I be representin' hip hop
Start at the bottom, then I'm climbin' to the tip-top
Yeah, y'all know my flow vital
Hypnotize rappers 'til they eyes turn spiral
Yeah, unh, I'm 'bout to smash it, no doubt
I got 'em all passin' out
Unh, I make 'em fall to the ground
When I be rhymin', I holla the sound
I always astound, you noddin' yo' head
You know off the top I'ma rock 'til I'm dead
Yeah, your whole vibe what I be enhancin'
When I start rhymin', the people start dancin'
Mack off the top o' the dome
Rappers wack, so you know I gotta slaughter y'all
Every time that I come with the flow
Better bet it be wetter than a waterfall
Ay, H-Mack, when I spit, man, they knowin' that I'm fly
Matter fact, I'ma reign supreme, so I make water fall from the sky
Unh, Mack, I'ma put it down, check out all o' my fly freestyle creations
Ooh, I'ma make water fall from the sky, wait a minute, that's precipitation
Unh, reign supreme like Portland weather
When it come to lyrics, Harry Mack do better
Unh, every time I rhyme, above average
Word to waterfalls 'cause my mind, it be rapid
Unh, movin' like the rapids in the river every time that I deliver
Pullin' arrows out the quiver, I'ma hit ya
Paint a picture, I be feelin' like Picasso
Every time I rhyme, I'm heavenly, you know I bring the god flow
Got you coverin' your mouth, lookin' at your friend
Like, "It's goin' mad long! Hold up, when it gonna end?"
H-Mack, y'all know that I keep it 'n movin'
Whenever I'm rhymin', you know that I just keep on improvin'
I get down, unh, everyone be fuckin' with the sound
Ay, didn't know before but I bet they know me now
Unh, rappers blind to my rhymes, I'm the one they can't see
Over beats I be sweet, somethin' like the candy
Come off the top with the lyrical riddles
They tastin' the rainbow, I'm talkin' 'bout Skittles®
I'm doin' my thing and they callin' me Jesus
I'm eatin' these rappers just like Reese's Pieces®
You know you need this, it's Harry Mack When it be comin' to bars, I'm much quicker
Haha! My bad, I heard this cat rappin'... Honestly, he made me snicker
H-Mack, comin' off the top and you know I'm about to grip up on the M-I-C and kill a phrase
Ay, gotta be the greatest on the planet Hold up, wait, no, I'm the greatest in the Milky Way
Unh, I'm 'bout to lay it down
When it come to bars, I don't play around
Unh, wait a minute, is he raw?
Yeah, I'm like a kid in the candy store
Shit is easy for me, it be heavenly
I'm the type o' rapper most o' y'all could never see
Unh, y'all know that I'm flowin' off my hype head
Peace, the two girls chillin' on the white bed
Unh, they be knowin' me now
I said, "What's goin' on?" You said, "She's over at my house!"
I was like, "Oh, cool, y'all are just chillin'?"
She was like, "Yeah!" But now I'm show-stealin'
The flow villain who comes right up off the tip o' this
Lyrics ridiculous, I'm low pro, inconspicuous
It's hard to see me, make it look easy
Y'all best believe me, I'm so sick that I'm queasy
I make you all nauseous, you better be cautious before you steppin'
Y'all know Harry Mack about to do work
Shout to the chick in the black tank top and love to the girl in the blue shirt

[[C]]
Birthin' the verse all up off the top o' the mind, all these lyrics get spawned
I should change my name to Harry Potter, I should change my mic to a wand
Yeah, I get loose with the tactics
Unh, and I'm tearin' through the fabric
Yeah, I'm really 'bout the raw rap shit
I'm like Harry Potter 'cause I'm workin' magic
Unh, and you know that I be hotter than hell
Every time I'm in the session, I be castin' a spell
Unh, y'all know that I'm ready to slam
I'm about to do a trick like, “Alakazam!”
Unh, when I be rappin', I never be small-time, I be on some big shit
Ay, hop on my broomstick, now I be playin' some quidditch
Unh, all on the field, ay, that's where you probably find me
Ay, ay, if I ain't there, then I'm with Ron, I'm with Hermione
Yeah, yeah, every time that I rhyme off the top I be playin' them god sports
Ay, I'm workin' magic, yes, I am a wizard and I am at Hogwarts
Unh, every time I grip up on the mic, man, you know that I'm truly controllin'
Ay, everything I write 'bout to make me a billionaire, that's J.K. Rowling
Unh, and y'all know that she really been hittin'
Harry Mack, off top when I'm spittin'
Shouts out to J.K. Rowling
She said J.K. but she really wasn't kiddin'
Really takin' over, built the empire
When it come to lyrics, man, they know I been fire
Comin' off the tip o' this, I'ma get you high like lots o' kush
I be goin' deep like a octopus
If it ain't natural, you gotsta push, I'ma get it done
Every time that Harry Mack is freein' in a session I got everybody on Omegle havin' fun
Let's go, ay, spit what I think
Don't need a squid, I don't use ink
Unh, when I be on it, I'm spittin' the lyrics they sure to remember, though
Everything that I spit gonna stick like a tentacle
I put it deep in your mental, though
Harry Mack, when it be comin' to lyrics I'm healin' your pain like the medical
Man, I got several styles I can use, I be up in my zone
I see you on the side, you filmin' on your phone
Anytime I grip the mic, you know I'm 'bout to damage you
Shouts out to your octopus, I'm diggin' that stuffed animal
Comin' off the tip o' this whether high or sober
I said, "What you doin'?" They said, "It's a sleepover!"
Mack goin' in, mad style, I pack it
Brrr, too cold, you are gonna need a jacket
H-Mack, I be flowin' off the head
Shout to the two fans layin' in the bed
Every time I'm on it, man, I really take control
I'm known around the globe, she in the white globe
In the white robe, that's what I meant to say
Any rapper who be steppin' is gettin' sent away
It's Mack, I'm all up on it, and I gotta keep it honest
Every time I grab the mic, you know I keep it like a promise
Go beyond it when I'm on it with the double-time spittin'
I be gettin' loose, no beat, still rhythm
H-Mack, y'all know I really came to spit the flow
Peace to the homie with the iPhone video

[[D]]
On, on Omegle and I'm kickin' the flow, so let's go
Ah, yeah, c'mon, all right
Listen, unh, yo, yo
When it come to freestyle lyrics, H-Mack the high roller
I'm in charge like I'm grippin' on the controller
Yeah, and I leave tracks smothered for sure
My mic is in the red, kinda like the color o' yours
Yeah, compared to other rappers, I be spittin' more tight
I said, "What games?" You said, "2K and Fortnite!"
Yeah, "Well, Fortnite, I ain't really that into...
...But I play it 'cause all my friends do!"
H-Mack, I be the one and only
You playin' Fortnite with your homies
Mack, I'm goin' in, I spew spray all up in a new way
I'ma shoot my shot like 2K
Here to the UK, anywhere we at
Yeah, I'm known for always sprayin' raps
I'm doin' my thing, off o' the top, I'm 'bout to slam
When I reference the words, I got my man sayin', "Daaamn!"
Yeah, other emcees, they don't tempt me
They brains like that water bottle on your desk: empty!
Unh, I'ma keep on spittin' 'til I'm dead, god
Peace to the homie who salutin' with the head nod
Unh, and I do this off the mental, I don't trace a stencil
So I'm never grippin' on a pencil
All my bars are major, I'm precise just like a laser
Rappers know I'm 'bout to flip it, hit y'all with eraser
Take you off the scene, H-Mack get live in the place
Rappers ain't permanent, they like dry erase
But when I do my thing, I'm never fake like a spray tan
So my word is permanent like graffiti from spray can
I straight jam, do it once again
I never grip the pencil and I never grip the pen
Yeah, already told you that my flow is major
Now after pencil, your original word was paper
I was like, "Unh... Well, you know I love to spit it, bruh...
...But pencil and paper, they kinda too similar!"
I mean, I love to stretch out and get creative
So I have problems when the words are too closely related
But, while we speakin' on paper, I'm 'bout to stack mine
Unh, everybody diggin' on the Mack's rhyme
Yeah, every time I rhyme, I'm Your Highness
They give me papers, but I gotta read the fine print
'Cause I know I'm gettin' hunted for these bomb raps
But before I read it, I ain't 'bout to sign no contract
Yeah, ayo, I'm on the track scorchin'
I understand money and that paper is important
But me, I'm 'bout my soul, yeah, I leave rappers bent
It's outta control, my verses are extravagant
Yeah, everything I spit be on next
Extravagant lyrics, man, y'all know that they complex
Ooh, I'm really goin' in to make it known
H-Mack, I be enterin' the crazy zone
Yeah, every time I rhyme, I'm shining like the high beams
Controller is red, but the mouse, it be lime green
Then it's purple, then it's yellow, then it's orange, what are y'all tellin' me?
Many different colors on the LEDs
Ayo, y'all know that I'm keepin' my rhymes true
Rappers' brains is closed like that door behind you
I'm about to shine, dude, blowin' up like bomb threat
You said, "Nice camera!" I said, "Do you make content?"
He was like, "Not yet," but you 'bout to run it
Savin' up for the camera that's six hundred
Crazy, I be lookin' HD, I be lookin' 4K
Bustin' through the doorway
Yeah, every time I do my thing, I make they head nod crazy
Workin' on the daily 'cause the Mack ain't never lazy
Like that!
