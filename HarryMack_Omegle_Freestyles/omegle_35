[[A]]
Yeah, yeah, ah, c'mon
Ya ya, ya ya, ya ya, ya ya
Ay, when it comes to rhymin', I'ma make you panic, bruh
We be connectin' from LA up to Canada
Yes, of course, I'm ready to scorch
Peace to my Canadian homie that's livin' up north
It's Harry Mack, man, yeah, I'ma throw it down
Ay, when it come to rhymin', my name 'bout to go around
I said, I show my face, y'all, no façade
When I be rhymin', now the homie sayin', "Oh, my god!"
Yeah, ayo, I'm glad we connected with each other
Yeah, we livin' life, that's one foot in front the other
Ay, we make it happen, man, y'all know I use this style o' rap
Peace to the city you're from, I'm droppin' Halifax
Heh, H-Mack, they never slippin'
I grab up on the mic and then I be steadily rippin'
Hold up, I said I'm 'bout to be the flow exposer
I rep from LA up to Nova Scotia
Wherever we at, I get clever with raps
I said they couldn't break me down 'cause I'm forever intact
My lyrics rare, make it crack like a snare
I stay lit like a flare, makin' corny rappers sit in they chairs
Hold up, yeah, H-Mack, movin' with the strong flair
Laid back with the steez like a lawn chair
Yeah, and you know I bring the thunder through
Got you slippin' like I pulled the chair out from under you
H-Mack, on another level, throw they hands up
Opposite o' chairs, when I'm rockin', they gon' stand up
I don't have to plan stuff, open up and bang flows
I get loose, produce more juice than a mango
Ay, H-Mack off the top, you better follow me
I'm about to kill the game and issue no apology
Yeah, and y'all know I rap, I don't sing
'Cause in life, you gotta focus on the one thing
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, you know I'm leavin' 'em shook
Peace to the homie up in Nova Scotia readin' a book
Heh, comin' off the top, in my shine, they baskin'
He's like learnin' 'bout doin' one thing, but multitaskin'
It's ironic, my lyrics iconic, I make you want it, he says, "Wow!"
Every time that the Mack'n get the loosest with the style
I'm blowin' your mind when flowin' divine, I'm showin' 'im what I'm about
When it be comin' to lyricism, you know I'ma stay on my route
I spit with the clearest vision and I just clearly hit 'im
Y'all know my spirit's liftin' outta my body 'n shit
I grab on the mic and I'm rockin' the shit
Yeah, come off the tip o' the mental, my flow is essential
No pen, no pencil, I don't need to trace no stencil
Got my own path, I'ma make 'em all feel the wrath
He put his knuckle to his nose, hand behind his head
'Cause he's bugging, can't believe all o' the lyrics that I said
Now I got him laughin' and he's slappin' his knee
Exactly, my G, it's H-Mack and rappin' with ease
Spectacular frees pourin' off my mental, I get reckless
I shine in gold, kinda like I was your necklace
H-yeah, and y'all know I came to rip the mic
One foot in the front the other, he knows how to live his life
Yeah, ayo, y'all know that these rappers get abolished
Respect you just for reading, you increasin' all your knowledge
Yeah, and when I'm rhymin' over tracks, I'm 'bout to frolic
Yeah, I said I'm flexin' on 'em, dawg, I'm gettin' brolic
This is H-A-double-R-Y-in', flyin'
Over heads, I be in the skyin'
From here to Halifax, H-Mack gets loose
And e'erybody love the vibes that my rhymes produce

[[B]]
Unh, yeah, okay, ah, check check
C'mon, check check, c'mon, yeah, yeah
All these rappers are irrelevant
Lyrics that I drop, they be phatter than a elephant
Check the way I bust, ay, you know it's a must
I said my rhymes rare, kinda like a elephant tusk
Unh, find another rapper who be live as me
I got the keys like ebony and ivory
Yeah, comin' off the tip o' this, y'all know we bring the funk
Ay, my lyrics 'bout to spray ya just like a elephant trunk
H-Mack, they lovin' all the lyrics I brung ya
I'm at home in the booth, like elephant in the tundra
Yeah, ayo, y'all know I'm swingin' through the safari
Rappers think they on my level but I'm yellin' out, "Hardly!"
I be doin' what I'm feelin' and y'all know we gettin' paid
Rappers get it twisted up kinda like yo' braids
H-Mack, y'all know that I be the rappin' Jesus
Earnin' stripes on the mic kinda like ADIDAS
Yeah, they lovin' all the lyrics that I'm bringin'
I said, "Where you from?" They said, "We out here in England!"
Ay, I be flingin' bars up off the top o' this
Told you I'm about to last from now 'til the apocalypse
Ay, I paint a picture
Every time I rhyme, y'all know I'm shinin' like a fixture
Yeah, you know I'ma smoke 'em up just like a Swisher
Winnin' at this game like it was rock, paper, scissors
Mack about to hit ya
Hold up, I told ya, yeah, I'm 'bout to push it
Steppin' incorrect to Harry Mack, I turn to butcher
Then I cut ya, then I slice ya, I entice ya when I hitcha with the blade
Ay, when it be comin' to lyrics, we all got it made
Ay, we gettin' majorly paid
Ay, y'all know I'ma hitcha nonstop
Ay, rappers pull out scissors so I'm pullin' out the rock
Ay, I'ma make ya stop, do it swiftly
Over for a rapper in the game that try to diss me
Ay, let's make it happen, they talkin' but I can't take that
Ay, I'm so sick you prolly need a facemask
Ay, y'all know that my lyrics get directed
Right out to my people and they all gon' get affected
Like a facemask, stay protected when you in my presence
Mack gon' hit you all off with the essence
Yeah, y'all know I'm bangin' them for sure
I'm high like the coats that be hangin' on your door
H-Mack, y'all know that my rhymes are hot
I can tell by your clock that it's nine o'clock
They be lookin' at each other like, "Wait, yo, that's amazin'..."
Grip up on the mic and I stay lyrically blazin'
Yeah, yo, I'm infinite with rhymes
It should be right on the dot, looks like it's one minute behind
Adjust your clock so you can get it in tune
If they didn't know, Mack will be spittin' it soon
Heh, I'ma make it clear, we really up in here
They lookin' at the clock; wait, wait, this is weird
Harry Mack, I'm about to make your speakers boom
They like, Hold up, yo, is he actually like in our room?
Yo, I'm locked in with the lyrics that are lethal
I had to entertain for all my people on Omegle
I be spazzing 'cause I'm the man
I just be rappin' for fans
I got the girl in glasses clappin' her hands
It's Harry Mack, you know I drive 'em mad, leave a rapper sad
Yeah, you know I got patterns, kinda like your shirt with plaid
Ay, doin' what I'm feelin', y'all, we made it forever
Just like your hair on the left, my rhymes is braided together

[[C]]
Yeah, unh, yeah, okay, ah, yeah, ya, yeah
Ya, c'mon, ay, c'mon, ay, c'mon
I got the bars they can't compute
Ay, eatin' rappers like pineapple, they some fruit
Ay, come right off the top, y'all know I crush 'em into juice
Ay, anytime I'm rhymin', y'all know Mack is gettin' loose
Ay, check what I'm produce, I mean produce, 'cause that's what the pineapple be
Yeah, can't nobody really come and rhyme after me
I said I'm spiky, kinda like a pineapple skin
Every time I kick my lyrics, I be ready to win
Yo, let's do it, ay, y'all know that I'm 'bout to come and rock more
Ay, choppin' up the pineapple, makin' pastor
Yeah, for the tacos, y'all know I got the hot flows
Y'all know we get 'em started and there ain't no way to stop those
There ain't a livin' rapper who goes beyond me
Shout to the homie sippin' water out the neon green
I saw the water bottle, no doubt I get easy dough
He said, "I need a recommendation for TV show...
...I just rewatched Brooklyn 99," y'all know that my rhymes prime
When it comes to lyrics, they comparin' me to Einstein
Yeah, they lovin' all the bars I provide
Ay, when it come to spittin', I'ma take you on a ride
Hold up, steppin' to me, you gon' fall
Ay, I'll leave your blood on the wall
Ay, Harry Mack, when I be in it
Ya know that my lyrics is soundin' infinite
Hold up, hang me up on the wall like art
When it come to freestyles, man, I'm way too smart
I'ma do my thing, I don't play no part
Man, I'ma serve you up like à la carte
Yeah, yeah, bustin' through the wall
Ay, H-Mack, man, I leave 'em so appalled
Ay, I get loose every time I kick a flow
Homie, he was trippin'; did the bars and he said, "Oh!"
I'ma get up in it when I'm on the mic, I'm doin' what I do
Ay, is that your favorite color? You said blue
Ay, well, I be blue like a lake, blue like the ocean
Ay, goin' deep with the ill rhyme notion
I'ma leave a rapper's face black 'n blue
They sayin', Mack, my dude, no one comes after you
Heyo, I'm doin' what I have to do, I'm on a different level
You know the kid don't settle, I'm 'bout to spit forever
Ayo, I'm doin' what I must
Man, y'all know that they grippin' on the earphone wire
I'm about to spit some fire, I'ma lift you all up higher
Off the head
You threw the color blue but your sweatshirt is red
It's Mack, I'm blendin' different colors, y'all know we do plenty work
And when it comes to lyrics, man, y'all know I be all up on first
And then to second, then to third, I'm slidin' into home
Ay, killin' every microphone that I grip when I'm all up in my zone
Ay, doin' what I have to do for the homie who be representin' from the UK
Harry Mack, every time that I kick my lyrics, it'll be a new day
Got you doin' like this with your pointer to your temple
When it comes to lyrics, y'all know I'm anointed off the mental
Ay, H-Mack on a different sphere
I'm about to grip the mic and rip it clear
Ay, I be showin' y'all the way that hip hop should sound
Peace to my homie in the sweatshirt with the hood down
Noddin', I'ma do it often
Every time I rhyme, I bring a brand new concoction
Yeah, you was lookin' for some recommendations to watch on TV
But instead I blew your mind with the freestee, make it look easy
Let's go!
