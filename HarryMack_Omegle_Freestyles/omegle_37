All these other rappers only do it for the clout
Hold up, I don't do it for the fame
Naw, I do it for my own reasons

They ain't even believin' what I be bringin'

[[B]]
What!
Yeah, unh, unh, c'mon, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, unh
Unh, unh, yo, yo
What I'ma say to them
I am not from planet Earth, I'm a alien
Yeah, lotta rappers hungry but Harry is starvin'
I am not from Earth, I'm a mu'fuckin' Martian
Yeah, they love the way I do fresh flows
Pullin' up on the game in a UFO
Yeah, ayo, alien, ain't y'all ever seen him?
He ain't one o' those short dudes with green skin
Yeah, but when you hear 'im rhyme, you gon' understand
I'm a alien for real, rappers got the underhand
It can't be earthly, they heard me, I cut you like surg'ry
Every time I rhyme, I'm on a word spree
I'm from another planet, all my lyrics gigantic, they in the shuffle
Only way to visit me is space shuttle
Yeah, I told you I'm a alien, I figured that was clear
Wanna hit my planet, you gon' have to crack the atmosphere
Yeah, I grip the mic and then I kill a phrase
I mean, I ain't even from the fuckin' Milky Way
I ain't from the same galaxy that y'all livin' in
And you can tell when the rhymes, I start spittin' them
Do what I'm feelin' when I'm on it, feel the wrath
Ay, I'm addin' up my lyrics like I'm doin' math
Hold up, and when I'm spittin', I'm makin' people listen
It's like I'm doin' math, how I rep for my division
H-yeah, and y'all know I'm that gorgeous guy
My flows is fly, my lyrics 'bout to multiply
Hold up, ayo, they can tell my style is up
I'm tryna solve for X like algebra
Speakin' o' X, RIP to DMX the legend
People all across the planet, they love the lyrics I'm reppin'
These rappers just some wannabes, I don't think that they on to me
About to bend these artists outta shape, that's geometry
Trigonometry, calculus, they can't challenge us
Harry Mack, they love the style I bust
They know now it's us, yeah, my power's up, 9000+
Matter fact, I go beyond it
Every time I rhyme, you know my flow is honest
Harry Mack, I'm blazin', lyrics amazin'
Yeah, I'm a problem, a tricky equation
Yeah, all these other rappers, they sound too faulty
They can't get my math 'cause there's no way to solve me
Yeah, ayo, and y'all know we 'bout to permeate
Yeah, need no protractor to hit you with the angle of the flow rapper
Who causes mo' disaster
Yeah, when I'm finished rhymin', no one's goin' after
It's a closed chapter, y'all better believe it
'Cause when I grip up on the mic, I tear these rappers to pieces
Yeah, ayo, y'all know that I be rockin' it clear
You said bottle? That's funny, well, I got one right here
H-yeah, H-Mack, y'all know that these rappers never violated
Keep a bottle at the side 'cause I'm stayin' hydrated
And when I'm rhymin', man, they knowin' I'm the fly guy
The Orangetheory water bottle that you get for DriTri
H-Mack, yo, I be the role model
My fans hear bottle and they think of full throttle!
I'ma do that for the people watchin' me on rewind
H-Mack, man, you know I'm gettin' free from the mind
H-yeah, y'all know that I'm really gettin' loose when I spaz
Man, I'ma crack the beats like a bottle made o' glass
Hold up, and y'all know that when I'm rockin', I'm tight
I obey my thirst like I had a bottle o' Sprite®
Then again, like bottle o' Coke, my flow, you enjoy
Crack a bottle on these rappers, man, they gettin' destroyed
Hold up, I spit it sicker 'cause my brain's workin' quicker
Like light, I flicker, get you twisted like a bottle o' liquor
Hey, Harry Mack, y'all know my flow is vital
Old school like ceremonies that are tribal
Like bottles, rappers recycled
I'm here, spittin' it clear, I'm makin' rappers back down
Could tell you liked hip hop from the pictures in your background
Yeah, and they can tell the way that I slam
I see you got the image of that Kendrick album called Damn
H-Mack, when I start to rhyme, it ain't no way to stop me
Plus I'm pretty sure you got that cover from A$AP Rocky
H-Mack, I drop a verse, my flow is unrehearsed
In fact, I can see that your musical taste is diverse
Hold up, and when I'm on it, yo, I'm honored to say
I'm 'bout to sell more records than Lana Del Rey
Yeah, seen it on the top o' that, y'all know we here to spit this
The beat behind me switchin', Harry Mack, I kick it vivid
Yeah, the ill freestyle, I gotta report this
Coverin' her mouth, like, thank god I recorded this

Ay, popped up like, how you feelin'?

When I do a dope bar, I got you laughin'

I got love for the UK, so shout out to England
We all up on it, Harry Mack, I come with rap creations

H-yeah, and even from a distance, I'ma reach ya
I'ma educate ya with the bars, I'm your rappin' teacher
Yeah, when I'm live up on the mic, I'm 'bout to smash this
Yeah, I'm really takin' y'all to rap classes
I see my reflection in your glasses, by the way
It's Harry Mack, I'm givin' all o' y'all the time o' day
Ayo, when I'm kickin' lyrics, they know that I'm too hype
My lyrics the new type, I shine like your blue lights
Yeah, I'm up on it, y'all know that I linger
I be growin' longer than the nails on your fingers

She got the long fingernails that are baby blue
Yeah, and I'll show you where the passion be
I'on't wanna piss you off, 'cause if you scratchin' me
God damn, that dig deep in my skin
Yeah, ayo, my lyrics, they gon' peep 'em again

That a rapper should bust, she chillin' with her hood up
Yeah, we be all up on it, I'ma keep it honest, that's the fact
So check the way I get loose with the rap
Yeah, ayo, I love it, I wear hoodies myself
Every time I kick a lyric, I be boostin' your health
Yeah, ayo, the heartbreak, we tryna rise above
It crushes you to have that unrequited love
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, y'all know they ain't judgin' that
Ayo, when you love someone and they don't love you back
Damn, ayo, y'all know that it hit, kid
I can't believe that the love was unrequited
Damn, I wish that I could make 'em love me, too
Unh, someone tell me, what am I supposed to do?
Yeah, ayo, they hate me and that's the truest threat
I felt like we would be Romeo and Juliet
Ayo, now we tryna deal with all this pressure
I figured that our bond would be tougher than leather
'Cause I don't feel right solo, we s'pposed to be together
I thought that we could stay on this endeavor here forever
Never did I imagine you wouldn't say it back to me
Damn, now I'm lost, my G
I'm all up on this path feelin' lonely
I can't get love back from the only woman who just knows me
Yeah, I opened up my heart and it got crushed
If the love goes one way, well it simply ain't enough
Yeah, but it don't matter, in this world, we too strong
If they don't love you back, you strong enough to move on
Yeah, next one will be even better
The way I do these lyrics off the top too clever
Coverin' 'er mouth, they can hardly believe it
'Cause when it comes to bars, I tear rappers to pieces
Bring it right off o' the tip o' this, bars are ridiculous
When I be spittin' this for all my fans
When it be comin' to lyrics right off o' the top, I'm the man
I rock the jam, I'm goin' like way too fast
The pedal way down to the metal
You know that I'm never gon' settle
When it comes to lyrics, I'm gettin' you high like the treble
I'm droppin' it low like the bass when I rhyme in your face
And I got the lyrics that they could not chase
Yeah, comin' off the top o' the brain when I rock it insane
I be lobbin' the flames for the people all the way out there in the UK
It's a new day, we gon' do it today, we don't ever really hesitate
Lift up the chair and I levitate when I meditate
Once again, I'm never gonna fail
H-Mack breakin' down every detail
Delivered to another continent like e-mail
Spit it stronger 'cause my verses growin' longer than your nails
Let's go!
