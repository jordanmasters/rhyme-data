H-Mack gettin' loose with the music
Whether it be amplified or acoustic
Shine like star, deliverin' bars
I could make your head nod with an acoustic guitar
C'mon, think you on the same level, y'all should try again
Acoustic instruments like the violin
They be sayin', "Mack is crazy, we ain't never gettin' bored o' bruh...
...'Cause he's like a one-man orchestra!"
Unh, I'ma kick the hypest facts
My vocals are acoustic, so let's hold a mic to that
Unh, standin' up prouder, crushin' rappers into powder
Got the microphone to make it louder
Blast it through the speakers, y'all gettin' consumed
I'm in the studio with Primacoustics® in my room
Yeah, and every time I'm finished rappin', leave the beat bent
Before I rhyme, had to set up the acoustic treatment
Yo, my lyrics too astoundin' to y'all
Without the paddin', my vocal tone would bounce off the wall
Yeah, and that's somethin' I just couldn't really let go
Gotta sound clean, dry vocals with no echo
Yeah, y'all know that I leave 'em amazed
Let's add some reverb, turn the acoustics to like a cave
Yeah, I drop a verse like I'm in a massive church
Throughout the whole cathedral, my lyrics will disperse
I stand at edge o' Grand Canyon, then I let it echo, echo, echo
Got the mic up in my palm, I never let go, let go, let go
Matter fact, the acoustics, they be enhanced, 'hanced, 'hanced
Every time I'm rhymin', I'ma make you dance, dance, dance
H-Mack, they can't take my mic away
I be rockin' for the homie while he's puffin' on the J
Yeah, every time I'm rhymin', man, my lyrics are on point
Unh, my vocals is 'bout to get you higher than the joint
Yeah, H-Mack, I'm 'bout to make it happen, I do more harm
I'm a work of art just like the tattoo on your forearm
H-Mack, man, I'm breakin' down the notions, smooth as lotion
He be in the Hawaiian shirt, keep it open
I be swingin' like yo' necklace, people, they expect this
Known across the planet 'cause my lyrics are infectious
Yeah, every time I grab the mic, I'm here to rock ya, fella
It don't matter if I'm over beats or spittin' a cappella
Even with no music, electric or acoustic, I'm ready to do this
My vocal tone soothin', always improvin'
I'm not a rapper, dawg, I'm a movement So let's make it happen
Difference 'tween me and these other cats, they lackin' passion
Unh, when I'm rhymin', they be goin' crazy
My demeanor is cool, like your window AC
H-Mack, man, I spit how I live
Peace to the homie who be noddin', sittin' outside the crib
Yeah, ayo, I be old school like a relic
When I rap, I got your brain trippin' like psychedelics
Unh, what they tellin' me, rappers swell up with jealousy
I'm gettin' hella free, I ain't spittin' spit, this is LSD
I hit y'all harder, ayo, these rappers soft, they flaccid
I'm above the average, matter fact, you trippin' out like acid
H-Mack, I bust, dude
Ayo, I hop up in the venue and crush rooms
Got you trippin' like mushrooms
All around the world, they know me
Got you trippin' like you takin' some peyote
Too much of the Mack, you know you might just OD
Y'all can't lock me down, I came to keep my flow free
Story, I'm tellin' it, makin' it happen whenever I'm rappin', I never been clashin'
I'm doin' it triplets, you know that I rip it
I make ya say, "Ooh," when I just do what I do
Mack, I been keepin' it true, spread like the flu, spread like the Covid
I got you doin' like this with your shoulders
All o' my lyrics, they soundin' much colder
You know I still be rhymin' when older Already got all the gray in my beard
Yeah, representin' the wisdom, come off the top with the vision
Yeah, yo, top, the position for me
Thanks so much for takin' time just to listen to me
I appreciate it much while you smokin' the Dutch
You got the J rolled proper and you grip on the crutch
Heh, doin' what I feel and you know that it's stupendous
Your word was a cappella, so here's how we gon' end this
A cappella, the word, I spit it absurd
I take the beat out 'cause I'm too sick to ever be cured
I can still feel the rhythm when I'm spittin' my vision
I don't write it down ahead, I use my own intuition
I shine and then I glisten, rhyme when on my mission
Y'all know that my lyrics divine, I cause collision
I'm crashin', spittin' with passion, I got you doin' the stank face
Even a cappella with no drums to bang bass

[[B]]
Unh, yeah, rappers is wack, unh, I might just have to get rid o' them
Ay, check how I rock, unh, hold up, wait, no, that's obsidian
Ay, Mack goin' in, ay, y'all know I'm droppin' them poems
When I be rhymin', I'm locked in the zone
Shout out t'obsidian, that be a stone
H-Mack, I be goin' in and you know I got the rap poems
Shouts to obsidian, that be a black stone
Mack comin' off o' the top and I'm reckless
My homie got obsidian all up on the necklace
Heh, and you know he had to hold it up
Every time I'm rappin', got 'im yellin out, "Holy fuck!"
Unh, y'all know I gotta vibe
With the obsidian necklace, got the pride
Mack, I'ma hold it up and I get love
Not only the necklace, you reppin' for the Cubs
Yeah, I can see it all up on the T-shirt
They said rap is dead, so this, here, is the rebirth
I'm about to bring it off the top, I'm 'bout to fling it I be hittin' everybody with the lyrics
Every time I'm doin' all my rhymes off the top o' the brain You know it's comin' from the spirit
Mack all up on it and you know that I'm on next
I be blowin' up kinda like a bomb threat
Yeah, you know I'm deliverin' the strong text
Matter fact, all my lyrics way too complex
Yeah, and it's complicated, dominate 'em Every time I'm in the session, I'm impressin'
Y'all know I'm manifestin' all my dreams 'n shit
And I mean the shit, serene 'n shit You know I spit it clean 'n shit
"Yo, he's legit every time he throws it down!"
Yeah, all throughout the industry, you know that instantly My name really 'bout to go around
Unh, yeah, complicated like advanced equations
Ooh, I'm complex with these lyrics that I'm blazin'
Yeah, y'all know I been the dude
I need a complex interview
They better throw my name all on their website
When I be killin' the game, yellin', "Dead right!"
Come off the top o' this Ay, to do a round for y'all, it's my honor, bruh
Every time I leave these rappers down and out
They call me the powerhouse: mitochondria
H-Mack, I'ma change the policy
Mitochondria be comin' from biology
Harry Mack, yo, I'm winnin' and you know I'm 'bout to triumph
Every time I'm rhymin', you know I'm droppin' science
Yeah, you know that I'm doin' it well, I'm hotter than hell, I came to excel
Hold up, wait a minute; cell?
That's what the mitochondria lives inside You know I spit with pride
I'm 'bout to flip your vibe, I turn ya upside down
All in the whip, we be ridin' around
H-Mack in it, my flow is amazin'
Shout to the homie reppin' GTRacing®
Yeah, I can see it on the chair right now
H-Mack spittin' with the flair right now
Unh, come off the head with raps
GTRacing® with the red and black
Yo, I came to peep but you know that my lyrics the deepest
You know that I'm creepin' and when I be rhymin', they stand away
I'm animated like anime
Mack, man, you know I spit it major soon
Droppin' all o' these major tunes
Homie, I be animated, kinda like the Pokémon, Charizard
Hold up, wait, Sailor Moon

Shout to the homie who just walked through the door
With a arm full o' tattoos and a wifebeater
Unh, H-Mack, y'all know I'ma throw it down Peace to everybody that I'm seein'
I be comin' off the top when I'm freein'
When I called him out, now he's leavin'?
H-Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to put it down forever
When it come to lyrics, I be way too clever
Comin' off the tip o' this, deliverin' the passion
Every I'm rappin', I got my people laughin'
Unh, and they know I'm a boss
Yeah, and I never take a loss
Every time that I bust, man, it's 'bout to get rough like a game o' lacrosse
Scorin' the goal, I just spit from the soul, man I'm holdin' it down and I never fall off o' this
Every time that I'm rhymin', you know that I'm 'bout to last long until I hit apocalypse
Yeah, and y'all know that I'm heavy, I studied hip hop kinda like a nerd
Unh, I think that was five, hold up, wait, did I hit every word?
Unh, I be keepin' it true, can't nobody out there do what I do
Can't really remember all five, so lemme hit 'em off with a quick review
Well, first, I think I said this
Unh, let me bring it back to remind y'all in the mix
Yeah, Mack, I be gettin' loose

Yeah, second word, that was ‘complex’
Second in a row, I get rid o' them
Third word, that was ‘mitochondria’
Fourth word, yeah, that was ‘anime’
Fifth word, yeah, that was ‘lacrosse’
I guess I got 'em all, so what can I say?
Mack, I'm up on it and I'm rockin' for the people
When it comes to kickin' lyrics, man, they know my shit is lethal
I be live up on Omegle and I do it on the screen 'n shit
And every time I say I'm 'bout to rap, you know I mean the shit
And every time I'm on it, I say ain't nobody like me
Peace to the homie, front row in the white T
Yeah, you know that I spit the shit fresh
My apologies to your friend who left

[[D]]
There ain't no stoppin' this, you know I'm rockin' this until apocalypse
Rappers think somehow they blockin' this, that thought's preposterous
Unh, there's no way that they could do it 'cause Mack is known to pursue it
And get the loosest with fluid, let's get to it
Unh, and when I'm rockin', they gon' go mad
You truly blowin' my mind with your vocab
Yeah, 'cause H-Mack, I drop the freshest vision
But I couldn't use two o' those words without a definition
Yo, I'm the visionary, yeah, y'all can picture Harry
Travelin' from my brain through your whole dictionary
Ayo, I'm here to hold it down
Yeah, I just open up my spirit, expose it, this how my soul would sound
Yeah, preposterous to think I'm losin'
It's preposterous, the way these rappers are abusin'
The industry, but I be cookin' up these lyrics instantly
I'm rollin' into battle like the infantry
Let's get it done
Ay, heart and soul, yo, that's where I spit it from
So clean, they woulda thought that it was written, son
Ayo, it's somethin' different, cook it up in a hurry
Ayo, shout to my friend with the hair that's curly
Ayo, it's Mack, I hold it down and y'all know I got the flow that you enjoyin'
This track what I'm destroyin'
All these other rappers hella wack, they mad annoyin'
They got me feelin' melancholy, y'all know they so poignant
Unh, yo, competitions, we be winnin' them, flavor like cinnamon
I'm deliverin' all the synonyms
'Cause y'all be evokin' the feelin' o' sadness
Every time you come through with wack rappin'
But Mack'n be out here to counteract that
Yeah, I'ma make you smile with these mad raps
Yeah, no longer poignant when I'm spittin'
Even if you in a bad mood, well, now, who you kiddin'?
See, I'm hittin', puttin' smiles on they faces
I said I'm leavin' listeners up in amazement
I'm on my very own path that I'm blazin'
In fact, my lyrics, they be harder than the pavement
Ayo, I'm the type that you could trust, I am truly plush
I'm the opposite of these liars and fakes that's dubious
Yeah, H-Mack, y'all know I'm 'bout to bust it
Record labels hella dubious, y'all know they can't be trusted
Fake rappers, they so dubious, there's no way I believe 'em
But Mack is never dubious, I'm tellin' y'all the reason
'Cause every time I get loose and spit it through the tongue and the tooth
Up in the booth, I be tellin' the truth
Yeah, and y'all know I'm gettin' fly, my G
I ain't dubious, you know you can rely on me
Yeah, I'm too sick to, like, ever be cured
I wanna thank you for teachin' me all those new words
Yeah, I'm out here to speak on the way I live
Right before you hopped on Omegle, yo, you was eatin' ribs
Yeah, I understand it, yo, I'm gettin' how you feel
'Cause before you hit the internet, you gotta eat a meal
Yeah, I speak on the things I do and think
By the way, I like your fingernails, the blue and pink
Multiple colors combine every time that I rhyme
Heh, bad vibes, I erase this, you got the bracelet
All up on your wrist and I can see it, that's for sure
H-Mack, I'm gettin' loose with the lyrics that are pure
Lemme read your sweatshirt so I can see what you reppin'
H-Mack, from here to Georgia, I keep steppin'
Yeah, I'm gettin' loose, I'm the reporter with the rhymes
I'ma drop a classic record like “Georgia on My Mind”
That's a Ray Charles joint that we bumpin' on the daily
Every time I'm rappin' off the top, I got you goin' crazy
Got you dancin' with no beat; that, there, is an accomplishment
I am never dubious 'cause I am such a honest man
Mack off the top, yo, he is absurd
Once again, thank you very much for teachin' me words

[[E]]
Mad intelligent with mine, they callin' me a brainiac
I be spittin' fire, hold up, wait, pyromaniac
Anywhere across the sphere, said, "Where you wanna go?"
And when my rhymes they hear, they say I'm phenomenal
I'm so intelligent, callin' me a brainiac
I be spittin' fire, hold up, wait, pyromaniac
Anywhere across the sphere, so where y'all wanna go?
When I hit your ear, you know it's phenomenal
Mack off the top and I never been a liar
Pyromaniac, how I light y'all on fire
Comin' off the top with the motherfuckin' brain
I be a dragon, the way I spit flames
H-Mack, I got the lyrics they can't catch
Ready to strike like a motherfuckin' match
H-Mack, y'all know I'm about to run you over
'Cause my tongue is like a flamethrower
Unh, and y'all know I'ma [?] you with this entire verse [Jumping the gun for ‘go’/‘blow’ in the next verse?]
H-Mack, I be comin' off the top, go up high, then blow up like a firework
Unh, pyromaniac, I lift ya higher, not no liar, I inspire
To be the one that light the track all on fire
I'm the rapper that they admire
Listen, I'ma open y'all up, no pliers
H-Mack, I just do what I feel
When they hear all the lyrics on the track Unh, that's where all the truth is revealed
I'm doin' me and I got your head noddin'
Comin' off the top with frees, dawg, it ain't no problem
Intelligent with mine, ay, they call me a brainiac
Light the track on fire, hold up, wait, pyromaniac
Anywhere across the sphere, said, "Where you wanna go?"
When my lyrics hit your ear, they say I'm phenomenal
Yeah, I work a miracle, I'm grand imperial I'm gettin' lyrical, I just be known
Across the whole planet, yeah, they know my name across the whole spherical
Shape o' the earth, y'all know I'm droppin' a verse, I do this shit unrehearsed
Ay, every time I rhyme, it's a holy experience, I'm about to take y'all to church
Let's go, when I kick my lyrics, I'ma make y'all think
I said, "I need three words!" They was like, "Wait, no, hold my drink!"
Yeah, off o' the top I'ma bring this shit
Those are good words, well, you are English, kid
I guess it makes sense, so thanks for the vocab
Every time I rhyme off top, they gon' go mad
Yeah, and you know I do it often Whenever I'm rockin', I got your jaw droppin'
Unh, y'all know I'm 'bout to let ya listen
They were like, "Both of us are musicians!"
I was like, "Cool, do your thing!"
She was like, "Yeah, both of us sing!"
But, the list would be infinite
If you tried to name all o' your instruments
I'm the illest and they can't fuck with that
Goin' over domes, kinda like your bucket hat
H-Mack, when I'm on it, man, they love the way I'm rippin'
And while I'm kickin' freestyles, you be sippin'
Unh, and you know I keep my rhymes true
I be shinin' bright like the light right behind you
H-Mack, I'm on it and I'm goin' where they wanna go
And they know my lyrics are phenomenal
What, I'm intelligent, they call me a brainiac
Light the track on fire, hold up, wait, pyromaniac
Anywhere across the sphere, said, "Where y'all wanna go?"
When my lyrics hit your ear, y'all know I'm phenomenal
I'm mad intelligent, Mack is the brainiac
