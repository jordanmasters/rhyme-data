LIT! Every time I spit, man, I'ma light a fire like propane
LIT! I'ma wake you up like you just did a line o' the cocaine
Ay, H-Mack, man, I'm comin' through swift
I'm the type o' rapper that can never be dissed
Put me in your system, better turn me up louder
Crushin' rappers into cocaine, that's powder
Ay, I'm about to break 'em down
Ay, I will report my rhymes
Ay, I will explore my mind
Ay, I don't need to snort no lines
Nah, 'cause I be high on life every time that I vibe on the mic
That's right, H-Mack, outta sight, and I keep my shit tight
Ay, everybody really 'bout to peep it tonight
Ay, it's goin' down when I'm up in the place
Peace to the homie who be puffin' the vape
Yeah, plus he be sippin' a beer
Hold up one minute, we be gettin' it clear
Yeah, they gon' understand me well
He said, "I'm cultured, so I drink San Miguel"
H-Mack in it, man, they turn me up loud
Yo, right now, I be all up in your cloud
Hold u', and you know we in the house
Had to put his T-shirt over his mouth
Yeah, if I do it, I will be in trouble
I tried it for a second but my voice got muffled
Ay, y'all know I make 'im say, "Oh, shit!"
Every time I rhyme I'm 'bout to help you keep your focus
I'm about to help you travel from the mind, road trip
Every time I light the fuse, you know I'm too explosive
Ay, Mack, man, I really got the swag
I'ma put the whole game in a body bag
Yeah, I'ma show my style to y'all
I'ma getcha twisted like alcohol
I be rippin' raps and it's a fact
The kid named Mack, I gotcha twisted like ya sippin' that
The San Miguel, he cracked the can, I'm 'bout to rap for fans
Ayo, I really make it happen, man!
Hold up, ay, and you know we all up in this
Ay, I'm about to let you witness
He was like, "Cocaine, alcohol, and the last word..."â€”*ahem*
Did you just say women?
H-Mack, you know that I got 'em all flinchin'
Ay, y'all know that I normally wear jet black
He threw the word out, I had to correct that
Ay, I'm about to change it and rearrange it before I flame it, then aim it
Out to the people who be reppin' for my team
Peace to my man on the other side o' the screen
Mack all up in it, you know that I love words
I'm a nerd, so you gotta hit me with the buzzwords
Heh, so he gave me the love
I was like, "Oh, words that can give you a buzz?"
No doubt, that's dope
H-Mack, man, they love it, what I'm bringin'
Off the tongue tip, y'all know that I'm flingin'
Peace the homie who be reppin' outta England
Yeah, he was like, "It ain't dope right now...
...I'm in England but, yo, it's always shit."
I said, "What's wrong with it?"
He said, "We got COVID, wack-ass people, and politics..."
Damn, hope you can find a new way, hope I can lift you up right today
He says, "Oh, shit," swings his hand like this
Then he throws it in the other, I'ma leave the track smothered
I be callin' what I'm seein', I'm the dopest human bein'
When I'm on the mic, you know I got the style
Ay, I make a mosaic with rhymes kinda like your ceilin' with tiles
Ay, hold up, I roll up, I show you my skillset
It's Harry Mack, there ain't a beat I ain't killed yet
I do it for people when live on Omegle
I spark ya, I feel like your room just got darker
Your camera's adjustin', they love how I'm bustin'
He keeps on smokin', yeah, he keeps on puffin'
Mack, I be dope every time I create
I'm smokin' the mic like you smokin' yo' vape
Ay, blowin' out a cloud, I'ma hitcha with the rain
Harry Mack, I'm really flowin' off the brain
Got 'im sayin', "Holy shit," the microphone, I be controllin' it
I told ya that I'm fully sick, every time I keep it lit
Yeah, Mack back on, ay, crush it every song
Ay, y'all know I'ma spew spray from LA out to the UK

[[B]]
Yeah, ah, okay, ah, okay, ah, let's go
Ay, let's go, ay, let's go, ay, let's go
Stayin' tall, I ain't never been small
Live on the mic and you know we came to ball
We gon' make it happen, man, it's really nothin' funny
We about to ball 'cause we gettin' to the money
Yeah, y'all know that I do it like a sport
I'm about to ball, homie, I'm up on the court
When it come to lyrics, man, all my skills godly
You in the hot tub, so your camera gettin' foggy
H-Mack, man, I do it for my friends
Ay, he's gettin' hella foggy on the lens
Ay, I'm out here to rep for my people
Ay, had to do a live rap on Omegle
Yeah, y'all know I'ma strike like a boss
Ay, I said that it was foggy, now he's wipin' it off
H-Mack, when I'm on it, man, I'm live in your ear
Ay, now I see you proper and it's crystal clear
Ay, every time I jam, what, I'ma make 'im stand up
Peace to my man 'cause he be throwin' his hand up
Yeah, and I knew I would get love
Ay, peace to the homie in the hot tub
Nothin' subtle, all these rappers are in trouble
I'ma do it on the double and my name about to bubble
Like the water in the hot tub where you sittin', no bullshittin'
Every time I'm rhymin', I'ma keep it movin', never quittin'
Like that, I'm about to bring it in a new way
Ay, we be playin' 2K
H-Mack holdin' the controller
Ay, and they know I be a high roller
Unh, and the crowd's gon' holler
Pay me 2K, two thousand dollars
H-Mack, I'm live in a new way
Ay, got you paranoid, Y2K
They be panickin', y'all know I'ma break it down
They be stiff like mannequin with the fakest sound
Harry Mack, man, I'm stayin' up in it
Any competition that I enter, I'm about to win it
Man, I got the flow, I'ma let it go
Check the way I grow, I'ma letcha know
Once again, I'm 'bout to melt ya like the snow
That you seein' outside, raisin' hell
He said snow, but I kinda thought he said smell
Ay, comin' off the tip
Ay, plug in and I'm 'bout to rip
Ay, spittin' my bars with the purity
"Why are you hiding, was that for security?"
He was like, "Yeah," then he came up on the screen
They see me, I'm 'bout to rep for the team
Ay, I be out here droppin' all my thoughts
And I'm doin' this a lot, like the water I be hot
Homie, I'm about to boil, homie, I be livin' royal
Homie, I'm about to win it, I be gettin' to the spoils
Homie, I'm the one and only, man, you know I'm livin' bold
Somethin' like the snow on the ground, I be cold
H-Mack on it, doin' this for the reaction
When it comes to rappin', I'm doin' that with passion
He keep his hand up, man, I'm rockin' the crowd
H-Mack, that's what I'm talkin' about

[[C]]
Kill it every time, can't nobody dis me
I be throwin' lyrics like they was a frisbee
Ay, normally pop up, I'm wearin' jet black
My fans like dogs, they run out and fetch that
Bring it back, y'all know that they lovin' everything I throw
Yeah, I can't hold back, I'ma bring the flow
Ay, known for kickin' lyrics after dark
Havin' fun with my rhymes like playin' frisbee in the park
Ay, they think they on my level, I be saying, "Hell, no!"
When I rhyme, people's bodies jiggle like jello
H-Mack, man, I crush it on a beat
Lyrics just like jello cause I always spit it sweet
Let's go, ay, comin' off the top, it's nonstop
I'ma light the fuse, then I'm 'bout to let the bomb drop
C'mon, yeah, I'ma be the coldest on the scene
Stackin' money, dawg, we gettin' to the green
Reppin' for the team, ay, y'all know I get mean in the place
I'm leavin' corny rappers green in the face
They love the way that I perform, I'll be sharp as a thorn
I leave you torn, you thought that nothin' rhymed with orange
Well, I'ma change your whole perspective, rep for my collective
Dig inside my mind, I be gettin' introspective
She was like, "Hold up, wait, are you kiddin', bro?...
...I can tell you makin' YouTube videos."
Yeah, ayo, I'm 'bout to leave you bent
I said, "Yeah, I am," she said, "Damn, that is so intense!"
I said, "Nah, it's easy, I'm just gonna do a rap...
...I'm just gonna make some shit up off the top and that's a fact!"
Ay, yeah, and now they know what I'm about
Ay, blow your mind with the flow, cover your mouth
Ay, can't even believe the shit that I come up with
I'm bangin' with the type o' lyrics rappers just can't fuck with
Yeah, I spit it in the hardest way
All these rappers jelly like marmalade
Yeah, they love the way I do my thing
She got the hoop earrings, them some big ass rings
H-Mack on it and you know I spit it too tight
In the window reflection, I can see the blue lights
Mack all up on it and you know they couldn't hang, though
Like the earrings y'all are rockin', rappers 'bout to dangle
Off o' the edge of the cliff
Ay, could tell that I'm blowin' your mind
Ay, every time that I'm rappin'
Ay, y'all know I'm flowin' divine
Ay, I got her shakin' her head
Ay, y'all know I'm winnin' the game
Ay, other homie on the side, though
She's fallin' all out the frame, ay!
Ay, can't even believe it, I can do it high or sober
They be so impressed by the rhyme, I'm about to knock you over
She be doin' this in front of her face, wavin' her hand like a fan
Every time that I grab the mic, word to fans, 'Cause I'm about to make you a fan
Ay, H-Mack don't need a plan
Ay, come off the top of the brain
Ay, every time I vibe these lyrics
Ay, y'all know they're fuckin' insane
Do it for my people, live on Omegle
Y'all know I got no equal
Every time I'm on it, I press a bigger threat
She be lightin' the cigarette
Hold up, all my bars on point
Hold up, not a cigarette, it's a joint
H-Mack, you know that I'm gifted
She be smokin' that and she's gettin' mad lifted
H-Mack, man, I get through the drama
Ay, that's word to my mama
Well, tell me, is it tobacco?
Or are you rollin' marijuana?
H-Mack, man, I'm spittin' it fly
When it comes to rhymes, ain't no one as sick as this guy
Yeah, ayo, y'all know I ain't a joke, on my life
Ayo, like you smoke the cig, I be smokin' the mic
