Lyrics that I spill are insane, ill
We gon to get this one started with the name Gil
Put me in your speaker system, keep it blaring
Poet on the mic like Gil Scott Heron
Yeah, and I be eating rappers off the dish
Speaking of Gil, I’m swimming through these tracks just like a fish
Yeah I keep it moving, no doubt I’m pain relieving
Uh, like a fish with a gill, that’s how I’m breathing
Mack all up in it, once again I’m never timid
Cause in the game of hip hop, I ain’t never been a cynic
Yeah, In this game yo we really bout to climb
This the first time you done seen a rapper collab with a mime
C'mon, And you know that I rock, I don’t simply talk
Unlike what you depict, I’m breaking out the box
Harry Mack, I’m about to carve my own lane
Yeah I be improvising lyrics off of the brain
Yo it’s insane how we moving, my lyrics colossal
Uh, I be holy on the track like an apostle
Inhale the cannabis then breath it out of the nostril
Rappers sell their souls for the money like it’s a brothel
Uh, they gon' do anything if they get lots of loot
Most these rappers in the industry like prostitutes
Ayo I’m about to keep my soul intact, y'all cannot control my raps
Every time I rhyme they be like holy crap
They told me Mack was nice, I had no idea
Ayo, I’m about to make sure that my flow is clear
Hold up, ayo I hold the mic closely
What you did there reminded me of an emoji
Yeah I got all these rappers overdosing, deep like ocean
I really need to match your hand motions
On another plane off the mental when I spit this
Tap in with my fans on Omegle, they bear the witness
Yeah, the ill freestyle I brung this
Every time I flow, I grow like toe fungus
H Mack man you know I’m about to hit it hard
Stepping incorrect to Mack you might be getting scarred
They be celebrating while I’m elevating
I can tell they hating from a distance, I’m still bitten with persistence
Yeah, and you know that I’m killing this for certain
I came back and said damn, you got your mic working
She was like, "It was working, I’m a mime, no noise
Don’t you understand I perform for girls and the boys"
All in between now her hands are going wild
Like she’s boxing with the camera and fighting with my style
Yeah we here together no doubt it’s not written
I said what do we have in common, we're both sitting
Yeah now I’m cooking up rhymes
We both realize that sitting is good for the spine
Yeah, cause if you stand all day when you teach
Eventually you need to sit for the spinal release
I mean, let’s be honest, I be working with raps
But if you standing all day you’ll be hurting your back
Yeah, she’s said I’m sitting, I was fully aware
But still I think it’s dope that both of us have our own chairs
Yeah, ayo, spit so fast you miss if you blink
I bet we probably have more in common than we think

[[B]]
Mic in my grip and I'm never gon' slip
I’ll be coming with the swag, y'all I came with the drip
H Mack all up on it I be making deposits
Never lost it, y'all know I got drip like a faucet
When it’s broken I’m never joking
Uh y'all know I'm kicking flows
Steady dripping like a hose, all up in the backyard
Uh, shout out to my fans on Omegle got me living like a rap star
Doing this for all of y'all I get liver
I come right off the top cause I’m the raw improviser
Yeah I go inside you with the incisors
Matter fact I’m dripping off the tip with saliva
Drip with the spit never been a hypocrite
Harry Mack they hear him spit, and they know he is legit
Yeah it's dripping off the tongue whenever I’m getting it done
When I hop on Omegle get to kicking the lyrics we all having fun
Uh I got the eyes open wide, every single time I improvise it's a vibe
Yeah this is not written it's off the head
Two dudes up in the front one chick sitting on the bed
H Mack I break it down with the visuals I'm seeing
Funky human being, off the top freeing
He's in a league of his own
I'mma put it down when I'm all up in the freestyle zone
Now listen, I'm on top of this, there really ain't no stopping this
Until apocalypse, dropping fatter than hippopotamus
H Mack, man you know I’m off the handle though
Matter of fact I'm not a human being, I'm an animal
I got the sick flow, I make the people get low
Abbreviate your career, hippopotamus turns into hippo
I'm the shit bro, you shoulda known it
Matter fact freestyling the illest component, that I be using
Microphone abusing, I'm the one they choosing
Uh the freestyle session is the arena that I get loose in
Who in they right mind would tried to step to me
The people know that I'd be charged up electrically
Hold up, everybody knows I'm a vibe
All at the same time they look to the side, yeah
Harry Mack man you know that I'll be rocking you
Someone's on the side of the screen, who are y'all talking to?
H Mack, man I'm rocking for my people
Someone came in the room and said get off Omegle
Mack I'm too lethal, I know the people feeling him
I'm blending with the instrumental just like a chameleon
Yeah my lyrics colder than a blizzard
Slither over instrumentals like a lizard
Never fail Harry Mack is certain to prevail
Word to the skin of chameleon I do it bigger scale
Yeah I hit you all with projectiles
Every time I'm rhyming man the people gon' get wild
Told you I got drip Harry Mack got a wet style
Matter of fact I crawl over these tracks like a reptile
Come on you know that I bring rhymes galore
Yeah, lizard like descendant of the dinosaurs
Come on I'm about to show you what freestyle is about
I got her trippin on the bed she straight up covers her mouth
I got the rhymes, inclined to shine
Like Einstein's mind, and I be growing like your wall covered in vines
Yeah, uh you know I'm controlling them more
Yeah, I'm about to push your soul to the floor
Yeah, and all these rappers man they know I'm the lord
I see up on the back wall you got a bulletin board
H Mack can't no one diminish my spit, hold up
We gonna cut the beat and I'mma finish like this

[[C]]
When it comes to lyricism, mine is delightful
Y'all know when I'm rhyming, I be shining like lightbulb
Anytime I'm spitting dog I'm making it quite clear
Lightbulb over my head I got them ideas
Yeah, ayo it's styles what I got
My lyrics is hot like bulbs with 10 million watts
I'm getting my shine, the people know I'm spitting divine
Y'all know I'mma boss, my lightbulb never turns off
I'm keeping it on to witness, work it out like fitness
Shining bright like colorful bulbs when it's Christmas
Yeah I'm doing what I have to do
Before you step to Harry Mack you better master you, that's just true
I'mma keep it on I'm too super
Coming out the future like the fastest computer
Yeah step to me, I'm about to leave you scarred live
Ayo, I be filling up entire hard drives
With information that I be dropping when I slam
I'm the man, goddamn, y'all know I'm increasing my ram
Yeah, let's put it down, kill the game I easily do
Y'all know I'm advanced just like a computer with that GPU
Coming through with the graphics card
Every time I rhyme drop magic bars
Do it for my peeps when I'm live on Omegle
Y'all know I be representing for my people
Mack up all in it and I'm spitting too fast
Yeah, step to me and I'm kicking your ass
Mack put it down when I rep my team
Live up on my computer screen
Yeah, I'm living my dream, I'm going too fast whenever I spit
Ay, when it becoming to bars I'm dropping the cleverest shit
Ay, do what I feel, I might replace ya
Never need no edits so I never use eraser
Come on, yeah said it how I meant it
Uh, every bar I drop is so stupendous
Yeah I got everybody going crazy, never lazy
They can't faze me, and the game cannot erase me
I'mma keep on going when I'm on it y'all know I kick major stuff
Ay, blowing rappers off the page, *hoo* eraser dust
Heh, Mack on another plane, yo I rip your mental
You rappers getting erased like I flip the pencil
Uh, I'm about to change the game right now
Uh, permanent like a pen, y'all need that wite-out
I make you white out like you bout to faint
Ay, I be doing shit these other rappers can't
Come on ayo I'm spitting in the tournament to push it to the brink
Can't erase me like I'm permanent ink
Oh, is that true? I pop up with mad crew it's the Mack dude
In this tournament I'm permanent like a tattoo
Yeah I'm coming with the major soul
In the place I'm so, unerasable
Yeah y'all know the Mack too clever
Can't erase my vibes, they 'bout to last forever

[[D]]
Said in the freestyle field I'll be owning this
The dude was like hold up I got to get my phone for this
Cause anytime I spit, ayo these rappers turned lip locked
My dude was like I swear I seen your ass up on TikTok
Yeah I'm known for kicking bars with the stamina
He said "Hold up wait a minute please look at the camera
Oh yeah that's you" he recognizes the face
It's Mack I'm getting busy when I'm live in the place
Now I'm the illest when I spit it dog I thought that I told ya
I'm in charge like I was holding on the controller
Mack I make it happen when I'm spitting them flames
The mic's my controller this is my video game
H-Mack I'm having fun you know I go ham bruh
Matter fact I take charge like I'm the programmer
And you ain't never heard this dude spit before
I'm throw back like we was playing N64
Got the controller with the three handles and the joystick
And the z-button for the trigger they enjoy this
H Mack on another plane over tracks I be struttin
Rappers tracks never get used, just like the c-buttons
Back for y'all these other rappers in the game
They don't really snap at all
The Mack evolves
Growing from a seed to a fully grown tree
All up in the zone that's where I'm gon be
Yeah, ayo they listening close each time I spew a verse
I don't only get props on earth, through the whole universe
Yeah it's Harry Mack my lyrics are gigantic
I swear to god they bump my records on those other planets
They said "who's that earthling the one that hocks crazy phlegm
"Let's bump his shit right now", that's all the aliens
In another galaxy
Listening to me because I'm true without no fallacy
Can't nobody challenge me I'm restoring the balance I'll be
That off the head god
Check out they way they locking in with the head nod
Mack yo, I'm coming thru flexing with the strong verse
I'm just on Omegle but it's feeling like a concert
Whole crowd going crazy, never lazy, who you wanna be?
Off the tip I swear to god I be the funkiest MC
Matter fact I'm bout to burn ya, do it to the third degree
I'mma have you have you slurring and slipping like off the Twisted Tea
Uh, I'm out here rapping for fans
Yeah they be pull it out the fridge and then they cracking the can
Uh, can't nobody out there really do what I do
When I be referencing all the words I make the homie say woooo!
No one can do this, for, rappers it's useless, my flow exclusive
My man also be doing music
Well props to you, what's your rapper name? I got to find out
So I can listen to your SoundCloud, hear what you rhyme bout

He runs to the computer, now he's typing it in chat
Uh, and when I kick the flow style, you know they go wild
Who can do better than the Mack? I feel like no child
Uh, and my camera's over here, you see the profile
Peep the profile, shout to Y-W

Cause he's never kickin those dummy rhymes
