[[A]]
Ay, most these rappers clowns like Ronald
My flow is addictive like the fries from McDonald's
Uh, yeah, understand what I'm sayin'
Rappers little kids, they at McDonald's in the playpen
Ooh, I come right off the tip and improvise, spit it wise
Matter of fact enemies salty like the fries, can't deny
Uh, every time he spits y'all know he's murder
Harry Mack is stackin' up like a cheeseburger
Ay, let's get it, let me get that number 3, let me make it super sized
'Cause I got the truest vibes
Truly live, do or die
Every time I grip the mic
Uh, fast food lyricist, I'm 'bout to rip tonight
Ay, break it down for y'all with the live crew
I'm at McDonalds all up in the drive through
I'm about to pull up, I'm about the get mine
Every time I rhyme man, you know I'm like a TEC-9
Blastin' off of the tip, got him covering his mouth 'cause he can't believe what I'm sayin'
Uh, When it be coming to lyrics right off of the top I'm not playin'
Uh, rappers, I'ma cut them well
He is so impressed by how I'm spittin' he says "What the hell!?"
C'mon, you best proceed with caution dude
He's like "hold up, wait, there's other people watching you
Are you cool with that?" All my rhymes sound great
I be eating all my enemies direct off the plate
Hold up, so sick I vomit, I'ma make 'em all want it
Matter of fact cause an earthquake like plates tectonic
Uh, Mack all up in it, I'ma take you for a ride
Got the whole planet shaking like plates when they collide
C'mon, yeah, y'all know the rhymes I kick are gorgeous
Quick to make like all my of enemies forfeit
He covers his mouth, he falls out of frame
He knows that the rhymes I kick are insane
Whenever I spit they know that it's flame
You know that I do this shit right off the brain
Yeah can't contain, it's comin' out of me
I'm 'bout to break it down, my fans are proud to see
Uh, when they hear him rhyme, they be like he's tough
I be eatin' rappers like a cheese puff
C'mon, when I do it I feel prouder
I got their fingers straight up covered in orange powder
C'mon, ay, open up the bag
Pop another cheese puff, bitch I got the swag
C'mon, I got just what you need, more tricks up my sleeve, you better believe
My chest dun puffed 'cause I'm getting the cheese
Hah, fuck with me, Harry Mack, I'm on another level
When it comes to lyrics, y'all know that I never settle
I keep it honest homie, no facade
I do a rap about the words and he says "Oh my God!"


[[B]]
I'm about to let my rhymes unfurl
While I take you all on a trip to Puppet World
C'mon, they ain't really understandin' him
Most of these puppets, they be stiffer than a mannequin
But not these ones I see 'cause they look real live
Uh, I'm 'bout to do a rhyme and take a deep dive
I be comin' off the top every time I report frees
Shouts out to the number one puppet named Corky
Uh, I just hope you understandin' well
We can't forget about his girl named Annabelle
Come on, ayo, y'all know that I be the time transcender
And in the background, it's more friends and family members
Yeah, see, up at Puppet World, shit is very drastic
I can see by the poster in the back they workin' magic
C'mon, and y'all know that Harry's a threat
I be pullin' more strings than a marionette
C'mon, I get down and I be the freshest rapper
Ayo, these other emcees are not a factor
Uh, I know he loves the sound
You can tell 'cause Corky's head is going up and down
C'mon, 'ey, step incorrect, they get hurt
Oh, my god, yo, your neck almost came out of your shirt
Ay, shouts out to Corky, you know that he's so fly
You can tell by suspender straps and the bow tie
Uh, I make it happen, you know I'm never fuckin' up
But plus he got the light blue shirt, which is button-up
I be gettin' down, man, I be off the head so tight
And shout to Annabelle in red and white
And in the background
So many puppets, yo, they threaten
When I kick a lyric, yo, I'm makin' Corky's head spin
C'mon, you know I'm fresh with the style
I'm never foul, make his head spin around like a owl
C'mon, y'all know I flow off the head over beats
Ayo, I love the way the puppets all are red in the cheeks
Ayo, I keep the flows free, industry can't expose me
My rhymes are like your cheeks, Corky
'Cause they be rosy
Believe it, I'm lettin' 'em know the secrets
You know that I'm goin' the deepest
I got the freestyles they couldn't freak with
Uh, yeah, you know that I'm flowin' strong
Shouts to Corky with the hair that's growin' long
Yeah, I really do it big, I'm never gonna fail
Up in Puppet World, yo, I'm sure to prevail
C'mon, they love the way that I lyrically rip
Welcome to Puppet World, I'm 'bout to take y'all on a 

[[C]]
Guaranteed I'm 'bout to wreck ya
Mack gon' disrespect ya
Lead 'em to the slaughter
Flows are hotter than the peppers
Got that insane flow
Blast off like a volcano
I told you I be hot like jalapeño
Uh, fly like a sparrow
I'm on the straight and narrow, sharp as arrow
Matter fact, I'm hot as habanero peppers
Each time I wreck ya, man, y'all know my shit spicy
These rappers hella lame, so they never entice me
C'mon, I'm the lyrical revolver, the flow evolver
I'm choppin' peppers like I'm makin' some salsa
Let's do it! Ayo, you think you CEO? You not, boss
This is not saliva when I'm spittin', dawg, it's hot sauce
Let's make it happen, man
These rappers sound like assholes
I smash foes, y'all know my saliva is Tabasco
Is that so? Mack comin' through I'm 'bout to do this
He pops open the water bottle 'cause I got the fluid!
Yeah, I'm up in the shuttle, I'm 'bout to blast off
First it was closed, he grabbed the bottle, now the cap's off
Makes sense, 'cause you know I'm 'bout to spit it off the top
Ayo, when I'm plugged in, I often rock
C'mon, yeah, all these other rappers violated
Sweatin' from all my lyrics, now he's dehydrated
We gon' make it happen, Harry Mack gon' get the reward
They be typin' words on Omegle with the keyboard
Yeah, ayo, I slay 'em with ease
Hold up, different type of keyboard
I be playin' the keys
Yeah, I be playin' chords that's gon' send ya straight to heaven
I be playin' like I'm either Herbie Hancock or Bill Evans
If not that, I might be Red Garland, the Miles Davis quintet
I'm goin' places where they never been yet
I told you I'ma fuck 'em up, I been a threat
Yeah, yo, these rappers, they can't seem to leave me injured yet
Oo! Lemme just do it, I'm hella rare in my stance
Uh, I be properly fitted in fly pair of pants
C'mon, ayo, y'all know I'm gettin' vivid with raps
I'm never wearin' khakis, though, 'cause the kid don't slack
Uh, come on, I'm out here livin' my dreams
Matter fact, I'm in my denim, music stay in my genes (jeans)
C'mon, it's in my DNA
Yo, hold up, what did he just say?
Got hard flows, this is in the pocket
Word to cargo pants with the camo
I'm loaded with the ammo
And y'all know that I'm goin' Rambo
Flow is off the handle, heavy like a anvil
Lit like a candle, I rep my fam bro
Kinda like the pics that's on the mantle
C'mon, ay, I break it down with them off-the-head raps
Shout to my man, red hoodie and red cap
Yeah, and you know I love to flex with flows gritty,
I be in LA, he's in Mexico City
For my freestyles, there is no replacement
I got fans in amazement while they rockin' the basement
Yeah, Harry Mack, I'm known to spit with no plan
He's so obsessed with the lyrics
He does like this with his hands

[[D]]
Listen, I said the energy shift is like night and day
The beat drops and they start dancin' right away
Uh, I'm 'bout to improvise live with the raw free
And while I spit my lyrics, they be movin' they bodies
Uh, I keep it real, man, I can't even front
I'm kickin' rhymes while the two o' them are passin' the blunt
Yeah, and like the weed that you smoke, I got fire
She be puffin' on the blunt, gettin' higher and higher
Let's go, I got the rhymes they couldn't believe
Y'all, I'm gettin' to the money, I be stackin' my cheese
Yo, it's whatever, I be tough as leather, I be doin' better
Bars they couldn't measure, gettin' paper
Stackin' up my cheddah
Uh, I do damage to the track when I harm a song
A lot of rappers, they be salty like Parmesan
Uh, y'all know that they wanna tap my mobile phone
'Cause the feds know I'm gettin' cheese, no Provolone
Yeah, and you know that I been flowin' a while
Reppin' Swiss cheese 'cause they got holes in they style
Unh, my name is Harry, my vocals carry
I'm lactose intolerant, though—can't have dairy
It's mad sad, I hope my words reach ya
It sucks 'cause I used to be in love with pizza
Now I can't have it, what the doctor said
Uh, check out all the lyrics that I rock off the head
I said it's ill how I speak, I be makin' 'em tweak
Uh, ayo, right up off the tip lyrics leak
Uh, c'mon, I'm just leakin' how I'm feelin'
I'm revealin', I drip like a leakin' ceilin'
Uh, yeah, you know that I'm really sayin' fuck it
Leak up in my ceilin'? I should prob'ly grab a bucket
Uh, I be spittin' flames right now
Uh, it sucks to have a leak when it's rainin' now
Uh, I'ma hold it down forever, I be livin' proof
Uh, yeah, drippin' kinda like a leaky roof
When I'm in it, man, y'all know, I'm about to kick the flow
I'm about to turn Omegle to a motherfuckin' show
Let's go, they said that rap was dead, well it's the rebirth
I got my own name on my fuckin' T-shirt
It's Harry Mack, now they all are understandin'
That's right, I had to flex with my own brandin'
Uh, yo, I kick several rhymes
On your orange T-shirt, you got the medical signs
H-Mack, goin' off, I perform for you
Ayo, she's blendin' different colors with the orange and blue
I be comin' off the tip, I brought that off-the-head flair
Peace to my girls on Omegle who got the red hair
Mack all up on it, I'm infinite when I'm spittin'
Man, I do it off the tip o' this, my flow ain't never written
Uh, I get you open, your brain I'm provokin'
So peep all my notions, they sippin' and smokin'
Uh, y'all know that I'm spreadin' the love
Smokin' the blunt while sippin' the tea out they mugs
