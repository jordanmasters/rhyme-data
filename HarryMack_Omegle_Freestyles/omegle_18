I drop a lyric on site, my brain too bright
I feel like the sun when displaying my light
Ay, when it comes to bars I be truly crazed
I bring light like the sun that's the UV rays
I be on another plane so dip into this
Ayo I add light to your scene like I was flipping the switch
I turn the lights on, Harry Mack I come with the hype song
Y'all know I'm 'bout to blow up in this game like a timebomb
C'mon, I get raw, I flow without no flaw
Peace out to my fellow artist yo, she loves to draw
C'mon, I'ma come with lyrics that they never said
Tryna shed all the negative voices inside my head
Uh, ayo, self love there ain't no one like you
Even though inside your head it says nobody likes you
You're fat, you're ugly, you're not that smart
But that is not real so don't listen to it, listen to your heart
Go inside yourself, you know who you are
They gon' try to dis externally but shine like a star
Cos the star brings the light that we all gonna need
Yeah, Harry Mack, I'm a fully evolved MC, let's get it
Sometimes when I'm looking in the mirror
All I feel is self-doubt, all I really feel is fear
It's some voices that some other people came and implanted
Gotta get rid of that so that I can manage
Now I grow like the plant that I see in your background
Rappers stepping to Mack and I be making them back down
Uh, I'm dropping knowledge, all my lyrics is smart
And like that woman in the second drawing, reaching for heart
H Mack, I'm off the tip of this, believe it I'ma win this
The heart is not attached yet cuz it's not finished
Well listen, y'all know I be rapping too smart
And to these bars I'm delivering, I'm attaching my heart
C'mon, I break it down when I be coming right off the tip of this
All of the bars that I drop are ridiculous
Y'all know that I stay low pro inconspicuous
When I'm up in the mix I see things clear
I'ma drop a lyric all up in your ear
Kinda like the wall right there behind you
I be reflecting like a mirror
Yeah, I'm connecting with all my people
Tapping in with my fellow artists on Omegle
C'mon, yeah, you know that I came through to destroy raps
It's your boy Mack, I really hope you enjoyed that

Yo, if these rappers think they better than Mack, they not sober
I'ma scare 'em like the last day of October
Ready to ball and my flow fully evolved
Rappers remind me October, they 'bout to Fall, ay
I'm staying locked in, check the way I'm rocking
Speaking of October, yo right now it's Autumn
What's the reason, I'm bout to run you through the seasons
Like weather in October, my lyrics is cold, freezing
Matter of fact I'm about to burn them into embers
Kinda like the fire pit when getting warm in December
I can't even front, turn up the system let it pump
Speaking of October, I got lyrics for every month
Ayo, twelve flows at once, got one for every month of the year
Ayo, I run it it's clear, I'm dropping something in your ear
Make it happen every single time I'm snapping
Man the Mack is taking action when he's in the session rapping
Let's do it, ay
My brain, I will expose this
Ayo, my lyrics beautiful just like some roses
And they loving the way that I perform
Said I'm pretty like the roses but I'm sharper than the thorn
I'm about to hit 'em
Ayo, are they better, no way
Mack got multiple colours just like a pretty bouquet
Bring the roses together I never settle
Speaking of roses, it's lyrics that I peddle (petal)
Ay, I'm on another plane
Ay, Mack when it comes to lyrics I'm so flame
Ay, they hear me rhyming they say that he's crazy
These bars that I kick like the ocean they wavy
C'mon, y'all know that I'm ready to speak
Ay, I just be wavy like rivers and creeks
C'mon, y'all know that my lyrics sound strong
I be calm, cause a wave like a petal in a pond
Feel the ripple effect when I catch wreck
And any time I start rapping, I got you snapping your neck
Uh, on top of these tracks I'm letting my words lay
She was like "Yo, can you fill out my survey?"
I was like for sure, I'll do it
But I'ma need three words just to bring this fluid
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, you know I be healing your pain
I did the survey, now you did the rap, that's a fair exchange
C'mon, I be the rapper all these other artists wanna diss
I said what's with this survey though, she said no it's anonymous
No worries, you don't have to give your information
I be killing the game by every indication
Yeah, off the top, yo, my lyrics get born
Said I'm wavy like the ocean plus I'm sharp like a thorn
Yeah, scary like October on the thirty-first, I tried to warn
I fill this rhyme out like Google Form

They see my videos on TikTok
Any time I’m spittin’, I get props
Mack in the session, representin’ for hip-hop
I’ma break it down cos I’m never irrelevant
Gotta put these young ‘uns up on the four rap elements
Talkin’ ‘bout the hip-hop elements, let me explain
It’s not only MCs spittin’ off of the brain
Y’know the foundation would be the DJ with the records
Using the turntables, more on that in a second
Another element would be the b-boys and b-girls
That be breakdancin’ all throughout the whole world
Can’t forget graffiti artists homie, that’s the visual
Without all four elements combined, shit is miserable
So I’ma put these kids up on the game
Yo, every time I grip upon the mic, y’all know I’m spittin’ up the flames
I’m here for all my people, man this hip-hop shit’s eternal
And if you not down with the movement I’ma burn you
I’m representin’ when I’m in the session, I’ma do work
Thankful to have hip-hop from people like Kool Herc
Grandmaster Flash, Furious Five, they bringin’ the message
I’m keepin’ it on forever, you know no one out there could test this
I’m blessed with abilities, step incorrect it turns fatal
Ayo, I got they head spinnin’ like a turntable
I’m doin’ better, I’m clever with lyrics y’all couldn’t measure
My vocal tone be soundin’ better like records
Compared to CDs, that’s easy
Believe me, so sick I’m queasy, I’ll need me
Huh, change the game eternally, I burn MCs
Shout to my man who be rockin’ the Adidas
I’m ‘bout to spit a whole fuckin’ college level thesis
I’m comin’ off the tip, I’m rhymin’ cleanly
They say the best, they mean me
I’m goin’ over head just like your beanie
The green be accumulatin’ as I get more in tune with myself
Y’all know I’m out here boostin’ my health, and boostin’ my wealth
Not only paper, also the spirit
These rappers talk shit on my name but dog I ain’t tryna hear it
I’m really in it, and right from the chest I be pushing
Flippin’ like a spatula when I’m in there cooking
Yeah, your vibe homie that is what I’m enrichin’
I be cookin’ up them lyrics, spittin’ live from the kitchen
Yeah, and y’all know they’re goin’ quite wild kid
I’m live from the kitchen like Flash in the Wildstyle flick
C’mon, I break it down for my folks, I’m droppin’ references
When it comes to lyrics, yo, I be the best in this
I be cookin’ and there’s no one out there testin’ me
I built this by myself so I ain’t never usin’ recipes
Homie I improvise, y’all know I spit it live
Ayo, your vibe homie, that’s what I’ma get inside
Yeah, right to your ears my lyrics directed
So excited when they see me on the screen, glad we connected

All these corny rappers bout to get abolished
Kinda like Yoda, I be dropping “gawledge"
Uh, I be dropping knowledge what I meant to say
Hold up, let me spin that one back Mr. DJ!
Listen, I said all these wack rappers get abolished
Ay, kinda like Yoda, ay, I be dropping knowledge
Come on, I’m known for improvising live on these hard beats
I be shining like the light up on these dark streets
Let’s get it, man y’all know my flows are hardcore
I’m dropping knowledge like I’m Yoda out of Star Wars
Yeah, I’m about to show you what I'm meanin'
Lyrical Yoda, I should probably have some green skin
Yeah, you know that they beg for bars
But I be training, learning the force at Dagobah
Yeah, I’m getting busy when I’m dropping the verse
Ayo, kinda like Yoda I should probably rhyme in reverse
I break it down for my people -- Ill, I’m mad
Yeah, when I rap, Yoda says, “Skills, you have”
Yes, it’s very true man you know I be your crazy chauffeur
Uh, I’m about to go viral, Baby Yoda
Come on, all these wack rappers get abolished
Ay, kinda like Yoda, ay, I be dropping knowledge
Let’s go! Ay, known for improvising over hard beats
Yeah, I be shining like the light up on these dark streets
C'mon ay, y’all know that my flow is sounding polished
Just like Yoda dropping knowledge, corny rappers get abolished
Any problem, I’mma solve it, man y’all know I kill these beats
Ay, I was doing cyphers on the corners of the dark streets
Now I’m here, ay, making it clear, rocking for my people
Ay, took it from the dark streets, and we up on Omegle
Yeah, you know I’m 'bout to kill the game homie, dead right
Yeah, all these streets are dark we gon' need headlights
Ay, they be shining when I’m rhyming, I’m the fastest thinker
Ay, on the dark streets switching lanes with no blinker
Ay, I go faster, matter of fact I cause disaster
'Til I’m running out of breath, and my lane the furthest left
Cause I’m moving hella fast when I’m all up to the task
Harry Mack, check how long I’m really 'bout to last
I be getting down for my man every time I snap man
Matter fact on the boulevard of the Batman
Speaking of dark streets, you know when I’m rockin’
Often, I’m about to take them all to Gotham
H-Mack getting busy in the flesh
And you know that I'm spitting it great
I don’t even need a cape
I'ma do what I feel and I’m about to make them feel so cray
Ay, feeling like I’m Batman, I’m recording in a cave
Ay, coming off the top of this I told you I got bars galore
Hardcore, shifting from Batman into Star Wars
Let’s go! Ay, all these corny rappers get abolished
Kinda like Yoda, I be dropping knowledge
Ay, I’m known for improvising over hard beats
Ay, shining like the light up on these dark streets

When people pass, their energy we lose
Can't believe she's gone, yo she used to love good views
Damn, uh, wish we could bring her back, I can't be in a sober state
Ayo, she passed on October 8th
Memories in the brain, we got plenty
Yeah, ayo it was 2020
Nowadays it be kinda hard to focus
Feelin' hopeless, ayo we lost her to the COVID
Yeah, some days I get sad, some days I get mad
Yeah, what makes it harder, I was the stepdad
To her child
Situation never mild
Can't believe she's gone, been missing her for a while
Gotta' bring her back, no shit
Tryna' keep my focus, COVID
Took away my partner for the roadtrip
Now it seems like I'm stuck all up on the highway of life
Ayo, it's hard for me to find my light
But we gon' get it, yo, we about to move through the pain
Yeah, we about to find more love in our veins
We gon' come together stronger
The love gon' stretch out longer
Our arms are extended
We said it and we meant it
We startin' new friendships
We 'boutta do our part
Ayo, when we lose human beings, it breaks the heart
But their legacy continues through the memories that we hold
That's what's gon' help us all move through the cold
To the summer season
I break it down for every reason
I can't even imagine, the type of pain that he's in
But hopefully even by connecting to strangers
I can help you find a way to just rearrange the
Energy in your mind, and focus on the positive
Yes we lost a good one, but we still gotta live
One foot goes in front of the other
So sad to lose somebody who was somebody's mother
Can't believe it, but we about to put together all the pieces
While my lyrics all release, I wonder should pray to Jesus?
What's the way I can cope?
I just need some hope
Yeah, ayo the memories linger like smoke in the room
Uh, and we gon' find a remedy real soon
Uh, and we gon' keep shinin' like the sun when it's noon
No we are not doomed
Hopin' I can lift your energy, with this here tune
