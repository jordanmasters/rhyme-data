[[A]]
Yeah, ah, yuh, yuh, ah
One two, one two, check, check, one two, one two
Awh, yeah, I hear it's been a graduation
So to y'all, I'ma say, "Congratulations!"
I'ma lift you off the floor and help you elevate
For all o' y'all, I think it's time that we celebrate
Yeah, we 'bout to turn it up a notch
I'm about to blow your mind, y'all had better watch
Pay attention to all the rappin' sounds
Graduatin' from the game without no cap and gown
Listen, unh, y'all know I'm comin' with the bars to rock
I graduate from the School o' Hard Knocks
Just to flip a freestyle for everybody in this
When it comes to lyrics, I be stretchin' so infinite
Unh, we poppin' up, they used to say, "Yo, who are we?"
Now I'm gettin' love from this whole Omegle party
Hold up, and when I do my thing, I'ma shine
H-Mack, steady gettin' loose with the rhymes
Now this the biggest party on Omegle that I seen
I be wonderin' how y'all fit six people on the screen
H-Mack, check out all the vibes I produce
I'm 'bout to bring the positivity to get y'all loose
Unh, comin' right of o' the top o' the mental, the people be knowin' I'm rappin' sick
Ay, pullin' the microphone all up out o' my cabinet
Yeah, 'cause I be the freestyle lover
Said I'm pullin' musical tools up out the cupboard
Yeah, y'all know I'm droppin' heat for fiends
Out my cabinet, brought the mic and the beat machine
Yeah, eatin' up these instrumentals like they was some porridge
Then again, my mic and beat machine is never up in storage
I got 'em on the desk, they ready for my use
And people love the rhymes I do and the beats I produce
I'm here to blow your mind with the improvised lyrics
Ay, graduation day, you know I gotta lift your spirit
Now, listen, I'm just tryna see a smile up on your face
Unh, beautiful just like the flowers growin' out the vase
Yeah, it's H-Mack, man, is he wack? No way!
Y'all know I be blendin' different colors like a bouquet
I hold it down while I paint it like Monet
Check the way the lilies bloom, Harry Mack, he's really illy
When he spills it to the tunes that are underneath
Yeah, when it comes to lyrics, y'all know they ain't wantin' beef
I perform, y'all know I'm torn from out the cypher
Sharp as thorn all up on the rose, my flows get hyper
I show the people how it's really meant to be
I gotta be the dopest rapper of this century
Now listen, if you sittin' down, y'all had better stand up
No, but for real, all o' y'all, get your hands up
Ayo, we 'bout to turn this here to a concert
It's H-Mack, I blow your mind with the bomb verse
Ayo, my spirit be the loudest soul
What you saw there was virtual crowd control
Yeah, wish I was up in the same room as you people
But we gotta make it happen right now on Omegle
Listen, I'm doin' what I'm feelin' when I rap
You got the water bottle in front your face with the cap
Harry Mack, I'm in the zone, I see you pullin' out your phone
I'm about to rep this nice crew, the phone case is ice blue
Mack, I'm up on it, throw it down for my people
Bars I'm kickin', they be lethal, and I really got no equal
Heh, they was like, listen, yo, this dude is flexin'
You ain't even listenin', you steady on there textin'
Hah, I'm just playin', in the conversation, I'm about to weigh in
Many microphones is what I'm slayin'
Yeah, I got the lyrics you can follow, no doubt
And if you text durin' my show, then I'll be callin' you out
Naw, all love, ayo, we 'bout to rise above
Said I'm really 'bout to win, that's when push comes to shove
H-yeah, and y'all know that my verses soundin' stronger
Checkin' out your fingernails, I see they growin' longer
Yeah, you got the green nails stretchin', like, a mile
H-Mack, I'm in the session straight-up flexin' with the style
Listen, and when I'm in the game, I go hard
Yeah, by the way, I really dig your beautiful scarf
With the colors and the flowers on it, Harry Mack, I make you want it
I'm so sick, I fuckin' vomit, cover your mouth
Yeah, I'ma throw it down for certain
Y'all know that I got 'em hurtin'
Goin' over heads when workin', that's what we 'bout
Yeah, I'm here for all o' y'all, we here to lift our vibe up
It's Harry Mack, you know I'm shining with the live stuff
I rock the world for all o' these girls
I dig the bracelet that you got on with the heart and the pearls

[[B]]
I'm here to show you I'm nice 'cause my flow is too hype
And when it comes to lyrics, they knowin' I'm colder than ice
H-Mack, I'm the freshest, get to tellin' around
I treat a rapper like ice and then I'm meltin' 'im down
Hold u', ayo, y'all know I be drivin' you crazy
My single 'bout to sell better than Ice, Ice, Baby
But it's no Vanilla Ice 'cause Harry Mack, I be the iller type
Known for pullin' out the lyrical blade and killin' mics
I'm gettin' loose, I'm sure y'all will remember me
Peace to these four friends chillin' in Tennessee
It's H-Mack, man, at y'all I aim this
I said I'm from LA, she was like, "See, knew you's famous!"
H-yeah, and y'all know I be throwin' it down
Yo, through the industry, my name is goin' around
H-yeah, why? Because I'm hella nice with the flames
I claim fame even though there's no ice on my chain
No jewelry but Mack's still 'bout to make it happen constantly
Yeah, I just fly over their heads, then I bomb emcees
Listen, if it don't come natural, I guess you gotsta push
When it comes to lyrics, mine swim deeper than a octopus
Yeah, and I'm movin' past the boundary
Lyrics like a octopus, they take the shape o' what's around me
Unh, runnin' lyrics like errands
Yeah, meanwhile most these rappers like a octopus, they transparent
At least semi, I been fly from the moment I started
As the greatest in the industry I'm 'bout to be regarded
Listen, I keep it movin' constantly, y'all know soon
Unh, I go through phases like the phases o' the moon
Listen, shoulda known sooner, I'm about to send it through ya
Said when I rhyme, inclined to shine just like the lunar
Rays, I'm here to leave y'all in amazement
H-Mack, His Majesty, hold y'all in place like gravity
I'm about to scorch it, the instrumental, I torch it
H-yeah, thoughts is like the moon, around my head they orbit
I guess that makes the brain my Earth, worlds inside my mental
H-yeah, I let lyrics unfurl, it's essential
That you follow me when I be doin' this, I got the dope flow
Yeah, I'm famous, y'all should prob'ly snap a photo
Unh, y'all know that my flow's phat, I own it
And every time I rhyme, it be a Kodak MomentÂ®
H-yeah, I grip up on the mic and then I damage you
I was like, "Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah, let's get off o' the animals!"
Then they said "butterfly," then they said "reindeer"
I'm like, "Please, y'all, I think we gotta make a change, here!"
Hold up, no more animals, don't get it twisted
Word to reindeer 'cause like Santa Claus, I be gifted
I'm flyin' over heads and y'all know I stay in rare form
I see you got the blue and white flag for the Airborne
Right there in the background, my lyrics soundin' well-writ'
And all up on your shelf, yo, you got the space helmet
I'ma need that before I'm finished with the song
Need a space helmet 'cause I'm gettin' lifted off the bong
Yeah, check the way we movin', I ain't never subtle
When I'm rhymin', yo, I'm like some bong water how I'm bubblin'
Makin' my people all want it, you know I'm on it, lyrics is supersonic
Unh, packin' the bowl o' the bong, we be gettin' high off the chronic
I'm 'bout to take ya much further, you know that I serve ya, I bring you the murdah
It's all on the platter, my lyrics are phatter, I got your jaw droppin'
Harry Mack hot whenever he's flippin' phlegm, listen to him
Get with the lyrics, I shine with the gems
Yeah, ayo, freestyle, you must have skills just to try them things
I dig your T-shirt, you reppin' for the Lion King
Well, H-Mack be gettin' busy
Damn, they hated, I'm animated just like Disney

[[C]]
Yeah, rappers talk shit, they don't really want none
My flow protected, just like a condom
Come off the top, I'm stretchin' like latex
Shouts out to condoms, we focused on safe sex
Yeah, I'm who they beg to see
Usin' the condom, no pregnancy
Mack, I just spit from the soul
I birthed a verse with no birth control
Come off the top and I'm ready to rock
All these rappers get chopped when I'm doin' my thing
Onto the words that I spit in the cypher
I know that these girls on the screen 'bout to cling
They wanna hear what I'm sayin' 'cause all o' the lyrics I'm kickin' is funky
Ay, doin' my thing, through all these beats I'ma swing, just like a monkey
Hold up, look around the room 'cause I be the room scanner
I go to beats like monkeys to bananas
Mack off the top, I'm about to send it through
Ay, I be hairy like a monkey in the zoo
Ay, do my thing, I'm about to make it clean
Every time I rhyme, I go ape
Yeah, goin' ape, somethin' like a monkey
When I'm on a mic, man, you know I'm too great
Do what I feel and I came to spit iller
But I be bigger so I'm a gorilla
Come off the tip o' this, y'all know I'm ready to represent
All o' the skills that I'm kickin' are evident
Do what I feel when I'm on it, man, you know
That that kid name Mack just be stayin' on a roll
All o' these rappers, they careers might be phat
But they comin' up short, so I'm callin' them a chode
Heh, check how I'm on it
Ay, microphone is what I'm owning
Ay, shout to the girl who be filmin' on the iPhone wearin' the sweater for Wyoming
Yeah, and you know I kick lyrics in ya ears
She was like, "I been moved to tears!"
I was like, "Can you tell me why?...
...Please explain why you're 'bout to cry."
She's like, "This here is my best friend!...
...We was waitin' for Corona to end!...
...'Cause we couldn't be up in the same room...
...And we thought we was gonna meet our doom!"
H-Mack, man, I'm comin' through to rock ya
I can see that you got the bottle o' agua
H-Mack, when I'm on the track, it's gettin' smothered
Plus you got the lights in the back with mad colors
Ay, tell me how ya feelin', fam
Ay, make heads spin like ceilin' fans
I can see it over you, you know I'm 'bout to send it through
Whenever I be rippin' this, these rappers are some hypocrites
And when I be spittin', man, I kill it, no doubt
She's so impressed, she be coverin' 'er mouth
Yeah, like this, when she's watchin', I'm strong
Yeah, now she's laughin', her hair color's blonde
Mack all up on it, where did your friend go?
I can't even see 'er on the screen
Ay, lemme see both o' y'all all up on it 'cause you know we gotta rep through the team
Yeah, move the bottle so I see yo' face
When I'm on the mic, you know I ride the bass
I do my thing and I hold it down
H-Mack be the king with the golden crown
All right, y'all know I made it like a song
Every time I rhyme, man, my freestyle's strong
I'ma bust, I just saw your hand and you holdin' a brush
Harry Mack, I come off top with the flair
I can tell you're takin' that brush right there to your hair
Just to straighten out the strands
Huh, e'ery time I'm spittin' on Omegle
People listen to the lyrics and they callin' me the man
Let's go!
