I don't never lie, only thing I'm tellin' is facts
Treat the beat like a candle, then I'm meltin' the wax
H-Mack, man, I never been no hypocrite
Every time, I spit the shit like I lit the wick
I said I'm on fire, e'erybody see the blue flame
Lit like a candle, got the Bic with the butane
Unh, I'm comin' off the top o' the mind
People get to buggin' when I'm rockin' my rhymes
Make y'all want it in the worst way
Ay, I be lit like the candles on your birthday
Ay, if you want the real, go ahead and press play
Seein' through the BS like a X-ray
I'm about to improvise a essay
Woo! I go deep, heh, drop a lot o' facts
Ay, ay, rappers fake, like a candle made o' wax
Hold u', they like Ripley's Believe It or Not
They in the wax museum, they ain't even that hot
But I'm a real human, flesh 'n bone
I'm about to test ya zone
Ay, known for gettin' busy when I'm on this microphone
Ay, I'm up in it, people better know that I go home
To the session, then I drop bars like a xylophone
Whoa! I'm really crushin', homie, it ain't really nothin'
Mack ain't never bluffin', xylophone, yo, that's percussion
Well, it makes sense 'cause I'm percussive when I drop my vision
AKA when I be rappin', e'erybody feel my rhythm
What! Ah! What! Ah! What! Ah! What! Look!
Come off the top o' the mental, whenever I'm rhymin', I throw down
Yeah, on Omegle, they all be lovin' my sound
I'm back in it, rappers gettin' mad at me, I use my faculties
To bring a natural disaster, I cause a catastrophe
What! Unh, every time I rhyme, it's from the purest brain
I'm 'bout to blow up like volcano, bring a hurricane
Yeah, catastrophic every time I rap with logic
Ayo, I'm 'bout to force these other wack cats to back off it
Unh, I keep movin', I'm constantly improvin'
Yeah, this ain't a rapper, this a fuckin' movement
Unh, ayo, you know my lyrics cleaner
I cause catastrophe, somebody better call FEMA
Yeah, we need relief, I ain't got no beef
Rappers bitin' my style, they got my lyrics in they teeth
Listen, I be a master, disaster-causin', do this often
Got the whole game in a coffin
Listen, ayo, y'all know I'm known for spittin' absurd
I was like, "Guys, you gotta give me long-ass words!"
Unh, and yo, you know that my freestyles dominate it
I was like, "Gimme somethin' kinda complicated!"
Yeah, I'm about to leave the track scarred
They were like, "Um, damn, this shit's fuckin' hard!"
I know, I put y'all on the spot
But finally we here and I came to rock it hot
Look, make you cover your mouth when I'm rhymin', it's lyrics that I'm dealin', fam
I'm 'bout to have your head spinnin' like your ceilin' fan
H-yeah, y'all know I'm doin' what I wanna do
When it comes to lyrics, y'all know they about to honor dude
Listen, and you know that I'm all on the rhyme spree
Multiple colors just like the flag behind these
Girls, I see it, listen, I get loosest with the rhymes
Ay, H-Mack, y'all know I'm producin' all the shine
Hold up, and I ain't weak, you know I'm speakin' with the pure voice
You got two bracelets and one's turquoise
I see the beads, listen, I'ma break it down with ease
H-Mack, known for improvisin' with the frees
Listen, ayo, I rap rare, I'm in my black chair
One got the blonde hair, one got the black hair
Ayo, I call out what I see right in front o' me
So what's it gonna be? I cause catastrophe, I'm thundery
I bring the storm, lit like the candle, full circle
I'm known for gettin' loose and makin' y'all laugh like Urkel
Hold up, I got you sayin', "Wow!"
I can see it from your mouth
You can't believe me right now
Listen, and y'all know I get mean with raps
I make you laugh, cover your forehead, then lean on back
Can't believe what's happenin', I'm rappin' in a whole nother language
Rappers, I fill 'em with anguish
You know I back up my claims when I throw it down, I be flamin'
Just like the wick o' the candle, I hit your toes [in] the sandals with the anvils
Mack off the top throwin' down for my peeps
Every time that I rhyme off the tip o' the mental, I'm goin' in deep

[[B]]
Ayo, the name is Harry Mack, y'all can type me up on Google
Yeah, right now I'm tappin' in live with Noodle
Unh, feelin' great, I'ma crush it, no debate
This the first ever time I freestyle for a snake
Yeah, I'm doin' me, man, you know I'm 'bout to damage flows
H-yeah, rockin' for the humans and the animals
We come together, man, y'all know I'm 'bout to vibrate
I was like, "Hold up, wait, naw, is that a live snake?"
Hold u', she was like, "Yes, indeed!"
Unh, well, thanks for comin' through and blessin' me
Unh, I got the lyrics that are sure to enrich
Yes, I do YouTube, I know you streamin' on Twitch
Unh, if we could stream Omegle, hold up, that would be so fresh
But I'm fairly certain we'd get banned for the TOS
Ayo, y'all know that I'm never 'bout to back down
I'm shinin' colorful just like the lights up in your background
Yeah, ayo, my bars about to beat ya
Ayo, what's goin' on, Noodle? It's so nice to meet ya
Yeah, I'm here to wreck them, man, I'm smokin' like a Rasta
Shout to Noodle the snake, ain't talkin' noodles like the pasta
But while we on it, I'ma ride tracks like stallion
I love eatin' noodles 'cause I love eatin' Italian
But let me make this straight, hold up, please don't hate
When I say I eat noodles, I would never eat your snake
Hehe, yeah, Mack off the top, you know I'm here
Ay, I'm kickin' lyrics that are definitely clear
Unh, and y'all know I'm here to go and earn the reward
Wack rappers are not my type, keyboard
Unh, y'all know I'm really here to bend the codes
Or maybe it's a keyboard like a Fender Rhodes
Yeah, and I paint a pure picture
If it's not a Fender Rhodes, maybe it's a Wurlitzer
Now these are classic keyboards that get used in jazz and soul
H-Mack, man, y'all know I'm out here rappin', though
I'm doin' what I feel like and y'all know I'm about to leave 'em floored
Turnin' the key to open doors 'cause I'm bored
Of these other rappers all throughout the industry
I take your word, split it apart, rework it instantly
Call it a remix, my lyrics holy like Jesus
I'm 'bout to improvise a thesis, tearin' rappers to pieces
Yo, he been earnin' stripes like ADIDASÂ®, bumpin' through your speakers
Yeah, I'm kickin' styles kinda like sneakers
Now listen, it gets drastic, never made o' plastic
Leavin' rappers with a cracked lip, they need chapstick
Woah, ah, back up on it and you know I throw down
Ay, Mack keep it honest every time I bring the sound
Ay, when I rock my lyrics, people ready to surround
Ay, when it comes to creativity, mine abounds
Yeah, I'm really here to rock it
My rhythm like some chapstick, it's in the pocket
Yeah, or in the purse, check the way I spit a verse
Movin' through the multiverse
Y'all can't control me 'cause I'm goin' deeper
I'm holy, they told me, I'm like holy cross
Ay, CEO of freestyle flows, the flowin' boss
Yeah, back up on it, I'm the strongest nerd
I was like, "Okay, let me challenge you...
...Can you, like, come up with a longer word?...
...You know, like, catastrophe?" She was like, "Catastrophe!"
I was like, "Damn, that's on me. I already rapped that, G!"
So we gon' switch it up, y'all know they can't get with me
Unh, it's never simplistic
Y'all know I'ma blast into outer space like a ballistic
All white but not albino, your snake is leucistic
Unh, I'm changin' every policy, they best acknowledge me
And thank you for teachin' me brand-new terminology
See, that's why I love Omegle, my vibe is enhancin'
I make people start dancin', plus my brain I be expandin'
From the brand-new terms I learn
Through the planet, I be spreadin' like a germ to earn
More paper, pullin' off the caper, I never got the fakest soul
I'm impressed by your snake control
Listen, H-Mack, I'm here to live my big dreams
Maybe one day, I can feature on your Twitch stream

[[C]]
Yeah, ayo, y'all know we 'bout to make it happen
It's H-Mack'n, I'm known for all the crazy rappin'
Unh, I be kickin' lyrics from the heart
Belongs in museums 'cause this here a work o' art
Listen, I get the ampest, I hope you understand this
I'm rappin' but it's sorta like I'm fillin' up a canvas
Yeah, I'm 'bout to throw down for days
Said I'm a artist with it, they call me Claude Monet
Ay, yeah, comin' off the tip, y'all best believe
Ay, I keep a couple tricks up my sleeve
Makin' moves and I'm destined to improve
Travel to museums, y'all might catch me at the Louvre
Unh, do what it do, ay, y'all know I'ma hunt 'em like a poacher
Catch me at the Louvre, I'm gettin' up on my culture
Yeah, checkin' out the Pablo Picasso, I blow your mind with hot flows
Yo, freestyles, I got those
I'm goin' in once again, doin' what another rapper really does yet
Y'all ain't really in the house, y'all still tryna sublet
Ay, H-Mack, I'm here to break it down
I be the realest one, I never been a fake clown
Ayo, I let y'all know, I'm still inventin'
These rappers sublettin' they style, you know, rentin'
Unh, but when I grip the mic, I be controllin' it
I ain't sublettin' these lyrics, I got ownership
Yeah, and y'all know I'ma rock, no doubt
Said I own these bars, kinda like I copped the house
No down payment needed, I'ma buy it in cash
H-Mack rhyme in a flash, get fly with my ass
I'm improvisin' 'til the last note, I'ma keep it mad dope
Ay, told you I'm a artist, my lyrics like brush strokes
Ay, y'all better feel it, I'ma make you stand up
She just can't believe it, she be laughin' with her hands up
I make you go mad, make you want it bad
I dig the black nail polish and the pink plaid
On the PJ pants, take a chance, I'm 'bout to break your stance
Harry Mack with lyrics way too advanced
Yeah, ayo, I told you that my rhymes is gorgeous
I said I'm freestylin', you were like, "Okay, I'm here for it"
Heh, I said, "Yo, listen, it's gon' be absurd...
...But I need three crazy, random, challengin' words!"
Unh, and I could tell when I said it, I had your face shook
You were like, "Hold up, wait, lemme check Facebook!"
Ayo, y'all know I be rippin' it quick
Yeah, every time I rhyme, I be flippin' your wig
Yeah, Mack all up on it, they'll be dippin' real quick
'Cause rappers ain't natives here, they lack citizenship
Yeah, H-Mack, I hold it down, I be kickin' mean bars
In my cypher circle, rappers couldn't get the green card
Ayo, I do what I feel, I got love for my supporters
Peace to e'e'ybody out there crossin' over borders
Yeah, if you workin' hard to become a citizen
Yo, those people, I can get with them
I support it, ayo, they puttin' in the blood, sweat and tears
So they belong to be here
Yeah, I'm here to represent for everybody strugglin'
The situation towards people in this country troublin'
Tryna find a way to fix it, I'ma let you witness
When I grip up on the mic, I work it out like fitness
Imagine crossin' borders just to get away from terror
Tryna make a better life for the future era
Tryna raise your kids so that they can do better
Tryna put 'em in a dope college to make 'em clever
And while you there, no one wants to give you love
'Cause you not a citizen, and you can't rise above
Damn! It makes me recognize how privileged I am
Yeah, so when I grab the mic and say I'm the man
Well, obviously I can do that, you know, man, I can
Because, I don't know, it goes with this society's plans
So listen, to all the people that wanna be citizens o' this here spot
That's workin' on the block
That's workin' at the jobs that we don't wanna do
Go ahead and keep grinding, keep reppin' for your crew
Yeah, I break it down eternally, y'all know I burn emcees
I'm lit like an infirmary
Y'all know I'm here to throw it down, it goes around
Forever I be rockin' mics so often
You got your hand like this, I got your head noddin'
Yeah, ayo, I come off the tip, I'm here to smash this
Peace to my new friend with the big cup and the glasses
Ayo, y'all know I be rippin' my raps
Just like the cup that you be grippin', I be sippin' on tracks
It's H-Mack!
