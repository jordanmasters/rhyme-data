And all about the planet, they about to know me
I smoke the mic until the room gets smoky
I be a rookie but I'm feelin' like a OG
I dropped a classic record, it was called, "They Told Me"
Yeah, yo, homie, what you got to show me?

Ay, I get loose inside the cypher circle
Yeah, Mack, I'm all up on it, I'ma flex, bruh
Lemme get a pizza, pepperoni extra
Add the anchovy, add the onion and the sausage
Every time I kick a lyric, dawg, my quality is lossless
I be on some boss shit, I'ma leave you frost-bit
I just keep on spittin' 'til I fuckin' get exhausted
Ay, I am the rapper they mentioned
I'm out here easin' the tension
Every time that I'm rappin'
I'm in a different dimension
Yeah, y'all love the way that Mack can control the verse
I'm in a different dimension, a multiverse
Expandin' every time that I be doin' me
I put my words together fluidly
Yeah, and y'all know I got the words they mentioned
Yeah, I take shape like the third dimension
Enter fourth dimension, then I bend time
Yeah, people's jaws drop every time I send rhymes
Yeah, I invent it for my people, they about to get floored
He was like, "I'm streamin' with my homies up on Discord"
Yeah, all these other emcees spiritless

Ay, make you dance, kinda like the cha-cha
Ay, be the illest rapper that you saw, bruh
Get you lifted like you smokin' on the ZaZa

Hold up, and I'm doin' my shit
Yeah, people get to trippin' when I'm spewin' my shit
Unh, ayo, I'm leave a whole field o' dead clones
Got so hype, you unplugged your headphones
H-Mack, man, you know I'm droppin' more facts, more tracks
Yo, he had to go and bring the cord back
Hold up, I'm too clear with the style
He walked upstairs, he ain't even hearin' me now
Okay, well, I'ma take this moment to leave all o' y'all dismantled
Lookin' at the screen just to rap for my YouTube channel
Peace to y'all, thanks so much just for watchin' this

'Nuff respect to Nicki Minaj
Yeah, that's the second word that you threw to me
Yeah, you know I'm about to do my duty, G
Yeah, every time I rock, I'm too raw, my god
Three styles at once, that's ménage à trois
H-Mack, off the top, you know I'm breakin' it down
I'm a king up in this thing with the sacredest sound
Yeah, peace to Nicki Minaj, but I'm never gon' need a façade
Every time that I'm rhymin', it's odd, you know I'm strikin' like lightnin' rod
Doin' the shit that I'm feelin'
Whenever I'm on it, I'm killin', I'm locked in with people
Ay, peace to these three girls that's rockin' with me right now on Omegle
Hold up, you know that I'm comin' in strong
Two got brown hair, one got blonde
Mack all up on it and I'm 'bout to bust free
And the blonde, yo, the color is dusty
H-Mack, I come through swiftly
Ain't a rapper in the game who could diss me
I'm animated just like Disney
Yeah, Harry Mack about to get busy
Yeah, you know that I really be that rare guy
Hold up your wrist, I can see you got a hair tie
It's Harry Mack, man, you know they sayin', "Holy crap!"
Pull it off your wrist to your hair just to hold it back
