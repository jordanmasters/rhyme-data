Check the way that I'm rippin', man, I got 'em all flippin'
I leave rappers terrified, they be scared, they be chicken
Yeah, check the way I'm doin' it, that freestyle guy
Word to chicken, word to birds, 'cause my lyrics too fly
I be comin' off the tip o' this and spittin' the best
H-Mack, I cook you up just like a chicken breast
Yeah, I ain't got no time to kick it with these dumb shits
Word to chicken legs, I got rhythm like drumsticks
Mack on another level when I do my thing
Improvised, leave you fried, somethin' like some chicken wings
Yeah, you think you on my level, problem is you not, boss
I'm spicy like some chicken wings up in the hot sauce
Follow along, killin' the song, none of these rappers have heard me
Similar but we be different, they be a chicken, I'm turkey
Bigger and badder when I'm takin' flight, everything that I grab on the mic
Just to recite sounds like somethin' you might sit down to write
But it's improvised constantly, I bomb emcees, I'm droppin' words
Ayo, I'm seein' to a distance, no binoculars
Yeah, everything I'm spittin' soundin' hella dope
They couldn't see me even if they had a telescope
H-Mack, man, my vibe ain't never subtle, you in trouble
Couldn't see me if you's watchin' on the Hubble
Listen, I'm in another galaxy, another stratosphere
Breakin' through the atmosphere, the dopest figure, that was clear
Wait, I'm breakin' through the atmosphere when I slam it?
I guess I'm in a spacecraft that's aerodynamic!
See, Mack takin' flight when he's doin' his thing
I'm movin' fast, aerodynamic when spreadin' my wings
Now follow me there, I'm 'bout to blast ya, I'm movin' past ya
I make ya gasp for air like asthma, I'm like NASA
I'm leavin' the surface and livin' my purpose, these rappers is worthless
When I'm spittin', they be sweatin', they nervous
I keep it goin'!
Yeah, the Mack ain't never fakin'
Fryin' instrumentals like we cookin' up some bacon
Every time I'm spittin', people know we gettin' reckless
[inhale] Damn, that smells good! Bacon is for breakfast!
We got the eggs as well, I'm goin' over easy
Rappers tryna spit like me but they do not please me
I'm so sick, I'm queasy, I'm 'bout to vomit
I crack your planet with the comet
Mack is fully up on it
I keep it honest, that's a promise
Yo, I'ma keep on goin' when I blast bars
From L.A. to Madagascar
Ayo, you didn't think my brain could stretch that far
Heyo, I race around these tracks just like a NASCAR
Ayo, it has to be so, y'all know we here to cause catastrophes
Actually, I'ma cause a casualty casually, I'm rollin' with my faculties
And utilizin' faculties to smash emcees
Yeah, holla back, my G
That Mack emcee be goin' deeper, y'all know what we on
Brand new lyrics is about to get spawned
Hold up, Madagascar is what I heard
And now I'm tryna remember, "What was the last word?"
Heyo, I'm here for all o' y'all, somebody remind me
["Blasphemy! Blasphemy!"]
Oh, it's blasphemy! You shoulda asked for me
I did that whole scheme about casually causing casualties
And that shoulda come after, G
But now I'll work it in, you better know the scheme
It's H-Mack, I be out here livin' my dream
Yeah, I grip up on the M-I-C and I create for y'all
How many people on screen?! Shout to all eight o' y'all!
H-yeah, I know all around the world, they heard me
Peace the homie with the basketball, homie in red jersey
Yeah, I get loose when I free these flows
He got the ADIDASÂ® jersey that says BMO
Harry Mack, I keep it movin', when I'm rockin', they gon' get amped
Shout the homie leanin' in rockin' the gray sweatpants
Hold up, and they be blown away by what I do for y'all
Then again, gray sweatpants applies to two o' y'all
Ayo, y'all know I live my dream with ease
This homie got his arm straight up leaned on the knee
Yeah, arm stretchin' across, I wreck like a boss
Yeah, when it be comin' to lyrics, you know that I never be takin' no loss
I just go in, I'm goin' deep when I be lyrically all in a creep, I'm never cheap
All o' these rappers, they claim that they flexin', but they hella weak
Listen, I'm off the tip o' the dome droppin' these fly poems
Peace to the homie in the back up on the iPhone


[[B]]
Unh, they can't ignore us, these rappers bore us
I'm a scary dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus
Yeah, they love the way that I flex, I'ma snap yo' necks
Compare me to a T-Rex
I'm goin' in once again, breakin' out the cage
Every time that I be spittin', I be truly in a rage
Yeah, I be mad phat, go over heads like a snapback
You should prob'ly video this, post it on Snapchat
It's 'bout to go viral, post me on your social fuckin' media
They can't really believe they seein' bruh
I be all up in it while I'm rappin' for y'all
You can tell we got them views from the plaque on the wall
Yeah, when it comes to lyrics, Harry Mack been doin' more work
I was like, "Gimme a word, you in the orange shirt!"
She was like, "Uh, I don't know, I don't know, lemme think of somethin'..."
Yeah, every time I'm in your speakers, keep 'em bumpin'
Yeah, y'all know that the Mack be doin' better
I said, "What you got for me, in the Las Vegas sweater?"
Yeah, you know that I'm out here to get props
She was like, "Uh, Snapchat? Okay, TikTok!"
H-Mack, I got exactly what you need
Okay, basically, the category is Social Feeds
Mack, I'm up on it and you know I always been the man
So while we at it, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram
Ayo, I break 'em all down to let the people know
I'm 'bout to kill the game while I kick the lethal flow
I was like, "Nah, new words, hold up, what we got on next?...
...Gimme like a crazy-ass long word that's complex!"
She was like, "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!"
Have you noticed Mack's the dopest?
I composed this magnum opus off the tip o' this
I'm too ridiculous, low pro, inconspicuous, there's no way to get rid o' this
Mouths open wide from the vibe I provide
Open up your skull; your brain, I climb inside, it's a vibe!
Ay, any track, I speak on
Shouts out to the girl in the orange with the bleach blonde
White hair, I'm right there, I'm here to letcha know
How many lyrics can I kick? I told y'all several!
Get you high like medical or eatin' weed edibles
Harry Mack, you know I'm masterful like Master Shredder, bro
Yeah, now I'ma make these wack clowns back down
Shout my homie Anthony, that's right, in the background
Ayo, y'all know that I blurt them flames
He's like, "What the fuck is goin' on?" "Naw, dawg, I heard your name!...
...Don't worry, it's not comin' through the IP address...
...Yeah, when I said your name, most likely ya stressed!"
H-yeah, I'm representin' for the land that I stand on
I bleed on these tracks, the beat is like a tampon
H-Mack, y'all know that my mental's vital
I said I bleed on instrumentals like a menstrual cycle
Yeah, H-Mack goin' in; styles, I got a myriad
On point like pyramids, I'm the illest rapper, period
Yeah, break it down for y'all when I bust
Unh, before tampon, yo, did you say brush?
Somethin' like that, and afterwards, it was eyeliner
I'm tall like skyscraper, I'm the fly rhymer
Yeah, you know that I meant it and I said it, need no edit
I don't wear eyeliner or cosmetics
Yeah, 'cause I'm here raw in the flesh, break it down
I told you I'ma kill the game with the sacred sound
Had to grab the mic to show you what the flame's 'bout
I had you terrified when I called your name out
Yeah, rockin' for the girls and boys
If you fuckin' with the flavor, y'all should make some noise

[[C]]
Unh, I'ma let 'em all know
Ay, thoughts, I'm provokin'
Microphones, I smoke 'em somethin' like a Marlboro
Yeah, I'ma press a bigger threat, facts
I'ma smoke you like a cigarette pack
H-Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to win with words
I was like, "We already got it, it's too similar!"
Switch it up, yo, we need somethin' different
From H-Mack, man, they better keep a distance
Yeah, and y'all know I'm goin' in
Any competition, H-Mack about to win
Flow off-kilter, step incorrect, I'ma kill ya
Harsh like a cig with no filter
H-Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to do it from the damn soul
I'ma build it by myself like a hand-rolled
Cigarette, all up in the paper, everything we spit sound major, pulling off the caper
When it come to lyrics off the tip, I'm the rhyme innovator
I'm about to ship new lyrics to the dome
Ay, y'all know I'm shinin' like chrome
Ay, I do this all from my home
Ay, they know I stay in my zone
Listen, I'm lockin' in with all my people
Whenever I'm rockin' the mic on Omegle
Y'all know that I grab it, I'm ready to spark
Peace to my homie who chills in the dark
Yeah, I see you there and you know my shit is more hype, more tight
All up in the back, you got the orange lights
Mack all up on it and you know I be the verse lord
Plus, behind the lights, I can see your surfboard
Mack goin' in, I'ma win, that's a real fact
Any track that I'm on, I'ma kill that
Yeah, and you know I'm 'bout to strike ya
Rappers useless like Marlboros, no lighter
Yeah, I be goin' in, if I'm gone, I'll be back soon
Shittin' on the game, yeah, the industry my bathroom
Mack on a whole nother zone and I got you all up in the inferno
I'm pissin' on the industry like it's a urinal
Harry Mack, you know my vibe, they couldn't spoil it
I'ma flush these corny rappers down the toilet
Yeah, I'm doin' what I feel, y'all know that I'm major
Unh, I be gettin' to the paper, but no TP
Ay, rappers so shitty, this is gon' be easy
Yeah, other emcees don't please me
Ay, told ya that I'm nice, best believe me
Listen, ah, y'all know I'ma put these rappers to the test soon
Ay, y'all are hella nasty like a public restroom
Ay, Mack, you know I'm 'bout to do this shit for y'all
Ay, shout to public restroom but the thing is I don't stall
Yeah, Mack, I keep it movin', I'ma travel with no manager
Ay, whole entire scene, man, you know I'm 'bout to clean it up, callin' me the janitor
Ay, Mack goin' in once again, yeah, you know that I'm 'bout to do it just like this
Check out the lyrics that I brung ya, man, I got the hunger, my tummy all up in a twist
Hungry to win the game, I spit the flames, I switch it up, I make you cover up your mouth
I kill the game, no doubt, I'm stayin' on my route, these other rappers do it for the clout
Woah! I be so hungry, I'm starvin'
I am not from Earth, Harry Mack is a martian
The greatest to do it, that's how they regard 'im
And y'all know I'm not here to trade, I don't barter
I'm about to hit ya, Harry Mack, I be that dude
I be in the mood for some big-ass food
All up in the game and you know it's high stakes
I really got the hunger, I'ma scrape that plate
It's Harry Mack, y'all know that they should be concerned
I'm hella hungry like a got a fuckin' tapeworm
Y'all know the track, I be beatin' it up
I even kill it a cappella, we ain't eatin' enough
I need more food, more cuisine, I'm on the scene
I spit shit clean, you know I'm livin' my dream
I got your eyebrows risin', you cannot believe it
When it be comin' to lyrics, I be tellin' you my secrets
Matter fact, I'm goin' in, you know I do it faster
I cause a disaster, I'm the freestyle master, I had to drop a chapter
Y'all know I destroy rap
It's your boy, Mack
I really hope you enjoyed that
What!
