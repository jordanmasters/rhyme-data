Ayo, it's such a pity, when they spit frees
They never witty, I'm the big cat
Rappers ain't nothin' but kitties
They some kittens
Check the way I'm spittin'
My lyrics, they be comin' off the top
They always hittin'
And I'ma press a threat, homie
You can place your bets
All these rappers like my kittens
They ain't nothin' but my pet
It's no sweat for me to grip up on the mic
And hold it down eternally, I burn emcees
I'm the rapper that they wanna learn to be, I
Be flowin' off o' the top 'cause I'm a god
I match to tracks like cats match to dogs
Yeah, and all my lyrics 'bout to get erased
Rappers cats, I'm the big dog, we be on a chase
Hold up. There ain't no rapper who be goin' beyond Harry
Matter fact I'm on the chase kinda like Tom, Jerry
Y'all know the cartoons, I be breakin' it down
I be holy with the rhymes, it's the sacredest sound
Let me do it, I'm the rapper that they can't see
When it comes to bars, I'm sweeter than the candy
So hand me the props 'cause you know these rappers bitter
I'm sweeter than the Milky Way
I'm sweeter than the Snickers Bar
I'm even sweeter than the Reese's Pieces
He's just Jesus with a thesis when releasin' flows
I'm a beast with those
Y'all better know I can't be stopped
Sweet with bars like a candy shop
Ay, I put it down when I'm rockin' it
I told ya that I'm hot
I swelter, melt 'er like the chocolate
Ay, I'm 'bout to turn 'em into puddles
When it comes to lyrics, dog, it's really nothing subtle
Now check out my rhymes, y'all know that I'm fly
I elevate like plane, I take off to the sky
So turn me up loud, I'm really feelin' proud
I'm all up in the sky y'all, I'm chillin' on a cloud
Feel me now, when I do it, I'm that true guy
You know that I do apply, my skills
To change from gray to a blue sky
Get rid of the storm when I perform, try to warn
Ayo, these other rappers gettin' scorned
Word is born
I'm about to do it kinda like none other
Kinda like the flags behind you, I got the colors
She got the blue stacked on top of the green
On top of the orange, it's lookin' like a colorful scene
Yeah, I grabbed the mic just to snap your neck, fo' sho'
And flex with flows, here to Mexico
So let me go direct with those
I'm 'bout to hit ya
Any time I'm rhymin', Harry Mack gon' paint a picture

[[B]]
I'm gettin' busy in the cypher circle
I'ma get you high like you smokin' purple
Mack all up on it, can't nobody harm me
Smokin' on the purple like the color of Barney
Smokin' on the purple like the color of bruises
Mack is the one that they always gon' choose, kid
Never gon' lose this, yo my flow is the loosest
I know you be wonderin', dog, who produced this
That's me, homie, I'm comin' through with the heat
Whether the lyrics or the beats, dog, I'm never discreet
I'm out in the open, for certain
And these tracks gettin' smothered
I'm so happy you said purple, that's my favorite color!
Yeah, ayo, they love to see me work the mic
Were you inspired 'cause you saw me in the purple light?
I got it all up in the corner and you know that it's shinin'
Mack's the ill performer every time that he's rhymin'
Yeah, I come right off the tip, you best believe your lights get saved
If you listenin' to Mack, you 'bout to ride my wave
Yeah, you know I'm good on Omegle but better in person
Riding on the wave like I'm surfin'
Cuttin' through like a surgeon
Y'all know I am never divergin'
Whenever I'm spittin', I bring the rhythm, best believe that
I got the passion for y'all
I'm like a big tidal wave 'bout to crash into y'all!
H-Mack, I got rare flavors, kinda like umami
Word to mommy, I'm 'bout to hit like a tsunami
The big wave comin' and I'm leavin' y'all wet
'Cause any time that Mack is spittin' he be pressin' a threat
Ayo, I, birthed the verse
I'm increasin' the birthrate
I cause a big wave like a big-ass earthquake
Off the Richter scale, I think it was 9 up on it
Ayo, you know that my rhymes is honest
Yeah, I align like comets and crash into planets
Cause a big tidal wave that's gigantic
And make ya panic, I'm in it
Yeah, deeper than the oceanic
They be runnin' frantic
Life goes up and down like a manic-depressant's mood
But kill the session, do what I forever do
Rep the clever few, come on
Yeah, told you like a earthquake, I shook him
He's out in Dublin but reppin' for Brooklyn
Yeah, I be doin' that crazy phlegm
Yeah, he said, "I just copped this shit from H&M!"
C'mon, ayo, I grip the mic and say what I meant
He's like, "Dog, I copped this beer for 75 cents!"
Listen, but isn't your beer culture real deep?
He said, "Yeah, but I'm a student. I gotta go cheap."
I understand it. Y'all know I come off top with the strong rhymes
He said he's in school right now, it's all online
Look, ayo, put you under pressure
He be sippin' on the beer while he's at a lecture
Uh! You know my lyrics really 'bout to damage ya
Dawg! Your beer almost blocked your camera!
Shit, I'm still here right now and I'm rippin' this
Feel like I could reach through the screen now and get a sip
Okay, y'all know I'm cushionin' yo' vibe
I said what was wrong and then he pushed it to the side
We here now, seein' clear now
I'ma fill him up with fear now
It's strange. I pointed it out and then he made a change
Get it? Yo, they be tappin' in
To check the way I spit it now
Listen, when I'm on it, I be rippin' the rhymes
I be goin' through changes like nickels and dimes
I be goin' through changes like jinglin' in pockets
We be makin' changes, there ain't no way to stop it
You mean change like the profit?
Or change like what's needed in society?
Change like the prophet who sees with third eye, my G
Talkin', I be lookin' to the future
I'ma leave 'em shook when I'm live on the computer
Now ain't this better than the college professor
Droppin' the lecture? I got the bars they couldn't measure
Steppin' to Harry Mack, you know you're 'bout to get hurt
Ireland in the house but Brooklyn on the sweatshirt

[[C]]
Listen, killin' rappers on a winnin' spree
Flexin' with the masculinity
But yo, when I'm in it, man, you know that I'm freein'
Ayo, I got love for all human beings
Yeah, and you know that this flow is do or die
Yes, I'm masculine, but I'm still allowed to cry
See, I don't base my masculine identity
On stereotypes. That's why Harry's so hype
Yeah, doin' what I feel
'Cause people live all up on a range of emotions
I got you overdosin'
Yeah, when I'm on it, man, you know that I'ma strike ya
In hip hop, sometimes the masculinity is hyper
It's way too much bravado,
Yes, I got the god flow
I admit I do it, but now I'm spittin' fluid
To educate the people on the need to be
Exactly who you are, and set your emotions free
Ain't no need to hold back and keep it in the chest
Put your thoughts and emotions into the world
Dawg, you blessed
Sometimes masculinity becomes very toxic
I think right now I'll take a moment to stop this
Gotta block this toxic masculinity
Yo, what's up to my girls? Where my women be?
Yeah, feminism, we need much more of that
Ayo, I'm reppin' for the girls while reportin' facts
Doin' what I wanna do when on the scene
For the men and the women and all in between
'Cause we know that it's liquid, we know that it's fluid
All up in my brain, homie, that's where my truth is
Break it down for everybody watchin'
Before you step to Harry Mack, you best use caution
Yeah, once I get started, there ain't no stoppin' me
I cause a world of chaos, that's my chaosity
You take a loss to me, they get panicky
Chaosity, I move through the insanity
Can it be? Mack is the man, my G
Yo, it comes right off the top, he don't plan the frees
Yeah, I damage these wannabes who refuse to honor me
So tell me now, what's it gonna be?
When I be kickin' my lyrics, I know they gon' repeat this
I span from LA land way out to Egypt
Come get with it, man, you know that when I spew a verse
I add on to the chaos in the universe
Yeah, I be the freestyle reporter
You better understand that from chaos comes order
We gettin' closer, you outta line then I'll expose ya
You know I chose to come off the top, ferocious raps
You overdose off that, of course it's Mack who's comin' through
Out the area I'm running you
This is something new and y'all know I'm on a word spree
I'ma keep it honest, best believe I'm trustworthy
Yeah, I'm up on this, I'm keeping it honest
And if I say it's true, then that is a promise
I won't break it. I'ma keep it. 'Cause trust is sacred
So come and peep this. Shout to my man, though
Ayo, I blow flows, right up off the tip,
While he be rockin' the polo
Yes, indeed, it's turquoise; yes, indeed, it's teal
Lyrics that I'm kickin', trustworthy 'cause they real
You know when I'm on it, I'm flying
Ayo, I'm high in the sky
And when I'm rhymin', I'm trustworthy 'cause I've never been lyin'
The rules applyin' to the Mack and attackin'
I'm never slackin', take action, I rep my faction
Get through the distractions
Trustworthy and, yo, I make it look easy
Said I'm trustworthy, so dawg, you better believe me!

[[D]]
]Ay! C'mon! Ay, c'mon, ay, ay
Listen, uh, I got the fly flow, they can't go where I go
Shouts out to my homie representin' for Ohio
Uh, yo I create too great
I stretch from LA to Ohio, travel state to state
We 'bout to do it like this while I'm rockin' the beat
Yo, every time I'm improvisin' I be droppin' more heat
I put it down for all my people
Pump 'em up like the Reeboks
Uh, shout to my homie comin' through with the beatbox
So shut your mouth and do it
I be improvisin' with the fluid, y'all know I'm the truest
Meditatin' like a fuckin' Buddhist
Representin' when I be inventin', I'ma flow free
All the people know me; shouts out, the homie Brody
Let's go, ayo, we about to be causin' a mean racket
When I be on it, yo, ya know the freestyles, I pack it
I just be comin' right off o' the tip o' this
It's so ridiculous, fans be knowin' the man when he pops up
I'm makin' 'em all understand
We got the triplet rhythm I'm makin' 'em listen
Whenever I'm spittin', I'm bringin' precision
You know that I come off the top of this
Harry Mack never be slippin' when I'm on my 'sition
I do, ah, what I feel too real
Ayo, I'm comin' off the top with the funky appeal
Now listen, uh, I'm fresh with the vocals
'Bout to give my man a solo
Uh, yeah, check the way I cling
Hey, Brody on the beatbox, go ahead and do ya thing.
