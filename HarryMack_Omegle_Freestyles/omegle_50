I don't write it down, I'd rather snap off the head
I be killin' emcees, I'm puttin' rappers to bed
Yeah, and y'all know for these styles, I got 'em thankin'
I keep the track warm like it's covered in the blankets
I bring heat over these beats, I'm non-discreet
I'm puttin' rappers to bed, I'm layin' 'em in the sheets
Hold up, hah, I'm 'bout to plug in to the live feed
Got these rappers all between the sheets like the Isleys

Rappers be soft like fuckin' down pillows
H-Mack, I'm on it, y'all know that they be peepin' the free

Yeah, the whole industry, I'm shakin' it up
Most rappers faker than fuck, that's why I'm wakin' 'em up
Listen, I do my thing, y'all know I slam the scene
And over tracks, I'm 'bout to bounce just like a trampoline
Unh, and y'all know that they love how it's sounding
Keep y'all protected like trampoline with net that surrounds it
Yeah, I keep it bouncin', y'all know I bring them true facts

Breakin' the trampoline, goin' down to the ground
Unh, I expand mentally, not bound to no sound
Yeah, keep it movin', y'all know we be doin' it big
I make you bounce like trampolines we would use as some kids
Yeah, all up on it, I'ma let my anger bust
Some parents said, "No trampoline, it's too dangerous!"
The kids was like, "Mom, why? I just wanna try!...
...I wanna jump! I wanna get high and reach for the sky!...
...I wanna be me! I wanna be free!...
...So please, lemme get a trampoline!...
...Come on, mom, please answer me!"
Damn it, G, we gon' take it further when I serve ya
Every bar I kick is murda, got that shit y'all never heard o'
Unh, so turn my vocals up 'til we up in the red zone
I sound good through speakers, I sound good through headphones
Y'all know that I come through off the top with this style o' spittin'
She was like, "What the fuck is an amalgamism?!"
H-Mack, man, in this game, I done dominated
My bad, I'm droppin' words that are way too complicated
From headphone, we went to microphone, which got me thinkin'
Hmm, what are other types of phones?
Well, when I do my thing, y'all know I send rappers the hell home
Bars get directed, stay connected like a cell phone
Mack all up in it and y'all know that I'm about to make you all feel the flowin' wrath
I'ma make heads spin like records on a phonograph
So many rappers in the game is who I'm goin' past
Y'all know that homie's trash, but homie blast, that be me
I got that level which is mastery
I be makin' moves, never passively
Unh, they know I'm flowin' divine, I be the role model
She be grippin' on the water bottle
I'm 'bout to rip it for my people, I'ma leave you all in ruin
I said, "What?" She said, "I said, how are you doin'?"
My bad, I got the intro down, check the way I'm rhymin'
I can see the wall behind you, it be glittery and shinin'
Yeah, H-Mack, I'ma run 'til I'm dead
Shout to the chick in white with the bun on 'er head
Yeah, Mack, I'ma break it down, y'all know that I'm truly rare
Shout to your friend on the side, fingers go through your hair
Yeah, y'all know I be testin' 'em with passion
And when I call out what y'all doin' with your live actions, you be laughin'
Now check the way I do perform
Hold up, move to the side, let me see that unicorn
H-Mack, I break it down, man, I see it in the background
I'ma keep it real, I don't never bring no wack sound
Yeah, they like, "Wait, how did you find me?...
...And how did you see through me and call out what's behind me?"
See, H-Mack got the bars you feelin' to the next day
I see through the bullshit, see through it like a X-ray
Yeah, I do my thing, to my lyrics they cling
You got the white fingernail polish, a whole bunch o' rings
Yeah, I'ma get it done, I make you cover your mouth
I make your jaw drop to the floor, y'all together, no doubt
Yeah, I'ma kick a freestyle, you gon' bug 'til the end
And when I really blow your mind, I got you huggin' your friend
You can't believe it, man, it's outta control
When I let these lyrics outta my soul
Y'all know I'm out on a roll
See, this is why I keep it locked on Omegle dial
See, I'm blessed to have this opportunity to make y'all smile

Improvisin' hot flows
Every time I rhyme, I got flavor like tacos
'Bout other rappers, I give not no fucks

Yeah, rappers kinda rockin' but not so well
They got them fast-food lyrics, word to Taco Bell®
H-Mack, when I'm on it, man, you know that I transcend through
I'm a five-star restaurant, this ain't on no dollar menu
Unh, yeah, and y'all know I leave 'em scarred well
Unh, crunchy tracks kinda like hard shells
Mack, y'all know that I really be the freer
Eatin' rappers up, I fry 'em just like a tortilla

Ooh, I got the game all up on wrap, like a burrito
Unh, y'all know I'm number-one freer, told you I cook up the tortilla
But I'm 'bout to tell these rappers that they cheesy, quesadilla
Ooh, Mack, I'm all up on it, I'ma keep it honest
Get the mic up in my palm, I keep it like a promise

H-Mack, y'all know that I'm crazy
Y'all can see me vivid like a monitor with HD
More than 1080
Matter fact, I'm 8K
Matter fact, I'm 16K
Can't nobody spit this way
Mack, I be goin' in when I come off the top o' the mind, I get that shine
People lose they motherfuckin' marbles when I rhyme
Hard flows, I hit ya, I'ma paint a picture
I make you think right, I be shinin' like your pink light
Unh, check the notion, I'm smoother than the lotion
In fact, the lights you got, they make your ceilin' turn to ocean
H-Mack, y'all know rappers, they don't even stand a chance
This is your preshow vibe before Valorant
H-Mack, man, I'm slayin' them lames
Unh, word to Valorant but I ain't playin' no games
Unh, when I kill the game, man, y'all know I do it truly
Better bet my lyrics be more wetter than some coochie
H-Mack, I'm on it and I be the sickest rhymer
Said they wetter than the coochie, they wetter than the vagina

Unh, word to corona but ain't nobody sicker
Ayo, I'm cuttin' through the track like a surgeon
Shout to Valorant, my perspective is first-person
Yeah, I be dope, ah, rappers don't have hope

Yeah, and y'all know every problem gettin' solved with words
I'ma brain from the drain somethin' like a colander
Wait, I said, "Brain from the drain..."
I meant, "Drain from the brain!"
I guess I flipped the script, these other rappers hypocrites
They talked about it but I did the shit
I'm livin' different, I'm rockin' for days
Your homie's walkin' away!
Hold up, yeah, when I rhyme, they turn me up loud

I come off the top and y'all know I'm 'bout to slam
When it comes to lyricism, they know Harry Mack's the man
And I'm doin' this for all o' y'all, my bars soundin' too raw
When I'm spittin', they be yellin' out, "Oorah!"
H-Mack, man, these rappers don't create at all
Basically, for Marines, that is like a matin' call
It's Harry Mack, about to break it down, I'm never playin'
"Oorah? Yo, what y'all sayin'?"
They like, "It's one of our sayin's!"
Yo, I'm comin' right off the tip o' this, I'm 'bout to slam
I'm the man
And I'm blendin' different colors like some crayons from Crayola®
Rappers only get they records played through payola
The illest off the tip, I thought I motherfuckin' told ya
Yeah, y'all know they know eventually
Ayo, they dropped the three letters, the MRE
Yeah, y'all know I get loose up on the beat

All these lyrics that I kick, they comin' from the soul
I'm the illest off the top, I think you oughta know
And shouts out to sushi 'cause, you know, I'm on a roll
Yeah, Mack all up in it, you know that it might be rumors
But I'm pretty sure his flow is hotter than the spicy tuna

H-Mack got the lyrics y'all can catch
Fresh up out the oven with the brownie rap batch

Ayo, I'm nice with the words, y'all, I serve y'all
Unpredictable with the lyrics, I throw a curveball
Check the style, make you say, "Wow!" I do it now!
Chip the ball, hit it off to the side, my lyrics foul!
Yeah, and y'all know I'ma leave you in amazement
Like we playin' softball, knock it out the park, slide into bases
Yo, I'm here to hit the home run, here to hit the grand slam
Every time I'm on the mic, you know I drop a anthem
Doin' what I'm feelin' and I leave y'all in amazement
Peace to my two new friends rockin' the braces
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm 'bout to kick a beast rhyme
When I call 'em out, they be throwin' up the peace signs
Yeah, yo, I don't play with the verse
I see the red letters, yo, but what's it say on your shirt?
Let me read that real quick so I can drop it in the lyric
Every time I kick a lyric, it emanates from the spirit
Now listen, when I'm live up on the track, I'ma flame it up
Fans go crazy for Mack like Beatlemania
Y'all know I'm 'bout to blow your mind with the verse
Big love to the most famous band on the earth
'Cause I bring the rhythm when I bring those bars
