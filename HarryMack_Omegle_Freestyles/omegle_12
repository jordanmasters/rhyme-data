[[A]]
Should I rap or chill? Sometimes I'm torn
Then I peel back anxiety, just like a orange
Now I know what I'm supposed to do
Letting y'all witness, I spit this
Dog, my saliva is citrus juice
I getcha loose every time I provide
The ill, multi-colored
Orange, purple, red, green vibe
Mack up on it and you know I'm on that fly shit
Changin' off o' orange, now I'm spittin' ultraviolet
Any different color that be up in my palette
Ay, it's time to vote, I be castin' my ballot
Ay, Harry Mack for President,
I rep the residence
I'm goin' places where they never went
My flow is heaven-sent, I'm on
Y'all know I'm really 'bout to spit this shit
They could not compute,
I'ma eat y'all like fruit
Make 'em yell out, "Oh, shoot!"
Harry Mack might just grab you
Rappers rotten to the core
Worms in they apple
Yeah, I'm doin' what I'm feelin' when I reach ya
Classic gift, kinda like a apple to a teacher
I got a classic gift, it's embedded at birth
You see, my classic gift is rappin' with improvised verse
And now I'm here just to burst
I do it unrehearsed
Holy with the lyrics, I be takin' y'all to church
I'm flowin' direct off the brain
When I be rhymin', they know that it's flame
Matter fact, I'm 'bouta get all the jewelery
I'm 'bout to cop me a chain
Ay, comin' for mine, whenever I rhyme
Kinda like chain, the way that I shine
You know I'm blowin' ya mind
Whenever I'm spitting, my flow is divine
Peace to the homie, ay!
Ayo, I know you can feel me
He said, "It's all black screens
Either that or the willies!"
I'm so tired of the nonsense that they showin' me
Happy to link with the god who be flowin' free
Yeah, here's a little break from all o' the mistakes
Ay, I'ma kill the verse, do it all in one take
C'mon, I earned the title, yeah, I'm gettin' the reward
They be typin' compliments all on the keyboard
Ay, y'all know that my lyrics is so tight
Shinin' so bright, had to switch to the strobe light
Yeah, and y'all know that they can't spit hard, not hardly
He threw on the strobe light, now we live at the party
Uh, and I'ma put it down, spit it fly
Painted on the wall, it says WHY
Why would I stop?
Homie, why would I quit?
Homie, why would the industry deny I'm the shit?
Homie, why would I ever take a break from the game?
Homie, why would they step to me? I'm fresh off the print
Homie, why would a dude like Mack hop up on Omegle?
Why wouldn't he rap in real life for the people?
I'll tell you why, cuz COVID droplets in the sky
It's killin' people daily and we cannot deny
We need a vaccine, homie
I be on it when I'm rippin'
Harry Mack, I gotcha trippin'
When I grip the mic, I'm flippin'
Compared to other rappers, all my lyrics is more tight
I know the category to avoid, it's Fortnite

[[B]]
Said in this game of freestylin', I'm the honor boss
My voice sound warm like the ramen broth
Yeah, and when it comes to raps, I'm top pick
I'm like ramen: I'm just what you need when ya sick
'Cause when it comes to lyrics
Y'all know that I'm low-pro stealth
What you need when you're sick
'Cause I'm boosting your health
It's Mack, I'm all up in it and I'm spittin' with the true vision
I'm like soup, how I'm boostin' your immune system
Yeah, goin' places most these rappers never been
Healin' your pain, y'all, my lyrics like the medicine
Uh, I'm out here just workin'
I love eating ramen but I hate the slurpin'
Sound that it makes, plus the broth be splashin'
The stains on my T-shirts, I hate it with passion
Yeah, but y'all know that your mind gets provoked
I had all kind o' Cup o' Noodles back when I was broke
I'm talkin' college, back when I was up in the dorm
But now, see, I'm known just to rap and perform
I get around the planet and I rhyme for mad people
But now I'm quarantined and I had to switch to Omegle
And rappers hella jealous 'cause I do what they can't
This beat is like the canvas, I'ma fill it with paint
Yeah, I'ma keep it movin', never down 'n out
Ayo, I'm fresh like the coat when you painted your house
H-Mack, I'm up on it and I'm holdin' it down
I'm a king in this thing, I need a golden crown
Yeah, ayo, I can face this or any other challenge
Feel like a painter, I'm just movin' through the color palette
Yeah, blendin' different colors with the mix
When it comes to lyrics, y'all know I'm the shit
I'ma break you off with the lyrical fix
Harry Mack, I'm off the head for days
Shout my woman in the sweater that is red and gray
I'm just doin' what I gotta do
Yo, when it comes to lyricism, I just slaughter crews
And come on, I'm tryin' to live in this bitter nation
Election comin' up, we got anticipation
We wonderin' what's comin' and we checkin' the polls
Honestly, the stress is heavy on my soul
I hope we find a way to regain control
I don't know what's goin' on, we 'bout to explode
Anticipation 'cause I be the hottest performer
Anticipation like a monster right 'round the corner
Anticipation like you watchin' horror film
Anticipate me spittin' hotter than a warmed up kiln
H-Mack, I'm up on it, I'm a burn y'all like clay
I just say what I say, and I lyrically spray
I get down for all my people and they love how I rock
She was quiet in the beginning, "You want me to talk?"
I said, Yes, please, indeed, now I'm spittin' it major
At first she was blockin' the cam up with the paper
But now we together and I'm droppin' songs
Me and my friend, we be rockin' on

[[C]]
Ayo, I'm 'bout to break you down with the freestyle notions
You know my flow watery, it's just like the ocean
Anytime I'm spittin', I be drivin' them crazy
My lyrics like the ocean 'cause my freestyle's wavy
You want the real, page me, you know I'll deliver
Said my flow is liquid water, dog, it moves like a river
Said it moves like the Nile, or the Mississippi
Ridin' on my wave 'cause they know my flow is trippy
It's me, the one who goes deep like deep sea divin'
I kill it every time I'm arrivin'
I'm in another plane with the crazy flows
I hydrate your whole brain like the H2O
Yeah, I'm up in the place,
I'm the one they wanna chase
Matter fact, they drop it low
And I rhyme like it's bass
Uh, y'all know I'm in the greatest state
I drop low with the bass like a 808
Come on, yeah, you know that Mack will be your father
Human beings are based on water
I'ma combine two terms, y'all better know what I meant
We made o' water, like 80%
I don't know how it's true 'cause I don't see any blue
I don't understand, man, I'm just one dude
But I'll break it down for all o' y'all
You know my bars are fatal
Rappers used to be winnin' until I turned the tables
Speakin' of turnin' tables, y'all know that I'm better
Speakin' of turnin' tables, well, I'ma press a record
Press it up to vinyl, put it on the turntable
Put the needle to the groove, show the planet that I'm fatal
Doin' what I gotta do, you know that I'm up in it
Harry Mack, you know I'm spittin' bars that are infinite
Yeah, and y'all know that I'm flingin' shit that's fatal
You wanna rap? Well, what you bringin' to the table?
He's holdin' up the bottle, homie, I'm goin' full throttle
And when it be comin' to rappin', I'll be the role model
Dawg, I feel ya, you know he's the one that I appeal to
Who's that on your hat that you reppin'? That's the Steelers?
Ayo, I think that I grabbed it
Y'all know that I'm rhymin'
Man, they got the emblem
And you know it's got the three diamonds
Harry Mack, I'm out here winnin' infinitely
I been a G, I spit for these peeps on Omegle
Clap your hands, I'm tappin' in to rap for fans
Get two thumbs up like it's Siskel and Ebert
They said that rap was dead, so I'm bringin' the rebirth

[[D]]
Ay, ay, ayo, I'm shakin' emcees
My man was on Omegle
He was waitin' for me
He said he been followin'
Ever since day one
Well it's time to freestyle
I'ma slay, son
I put it down, enemies is gettin' destroyed
I span from Los Angeles out to Detroit
Yeah, you know they gon' feel me out there
'Cause anytime I rhyme, I'm gettin' ill with the flair
Ay, vicious when I spit this
Do that off-the-head thing
Takin' flight like the Detroit Red Wings
Gettin' busy when I'm on it
Man, I spit flows
If you bite, it's fatal: black widow
Ay, H-Mack, I kill the cypher
Y'all know I'm hyper
I'm crawlin' towards the mic like spider
And you know, they can't even believe what he said
Crawl to the cypher like a spider
Then I'm weavin' my web
But it's a web of words, off the head absurd
Y'all know that I'm movin' fast
But ironically, my vision never blurred
I'm seein' 20-20, y'all know it's off top of the brain
Shout to my homie who be rockin' the chain
He got the cross on that thang
Plus he got the red and white stripes
Uh, y'all know that I'm gettin' hype when strikin' mics
Yeah, we all up in it droppin' bars
Peace to my homie who's kickin' it in the car
Now, listen, they can try
But there's no way they can damage me
I'ma hold it down with my people
That's my family, yeah
Shout to my sister, shout to my moms
Shout to my pops, too
Long as you got the fam on your side
Nobody can stop you
Y'all know I'm spittin' in every direction
Y'all know with lyrics, I got a collection
Y'all know I gotta send the affection
Out to my family, give me direction
Helpin' me know where to go
Whenever I'm lost on this planet
You know the love they givin' to me
Man, that shit's so gigantic
Never gonna panic long as they got my back
I'm tapped in, ready just to rap
It's the Mack, I'm all in effect when I'm live on Omegle
Gettin' down with some brand new people
Shouts to my homie reppin' for the D
Never write my lyrics, I prefer to keep it free
It's me, unh, can't nobody hold me back
My soul is trapped, had to crack
Right through the cul-de-sac
And now I'm here, they call me the man
It blows my minds, to be out here connecting with fans
Let's go!
