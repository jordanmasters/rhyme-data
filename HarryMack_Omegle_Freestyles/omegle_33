Ay, and y'all know that I'm explorin'
I be rockin' polo, I be rockin' Ralph Lauren
Harry Mack, I'm all up in it, y'all know that I'm prime
All my lines blurred 'cause they so fast, I rock designer
Never that, I'm in the black tee, y'all can see me
When it come to lyrics, I'ma make it look easy
Yes, of course, I ride the track like a Porsche
Matter fact, since it's polo, I'ma ride it like a horse
Yeah, we goin' in, better pay attention
I got all the lyrics that the people 'bout to mention
Hold up, y'all know I'm bangin' with the hard flow
They tryna find me in the polo, yellin' out, "Marco!"
Ay, I'm fresh with the vocals
Get to poppin' the collar on your polo
Flyin' over heads like a airplane
I'm the best flower, runnin' over rappers like the mower
Ay, comin' through, with the dope vocals
Ay, get to poppin' collars on your polo
Flyin' over heads like an airplane
I'm the best flower, you gettin' run over like a mower
I be high in the sky, chillin' up in heaven
I be high in the sky, 747
I be gettin' down, killin' plenty crews
Flyin' over heads like a F-22
Yeah, and I'm about to put my lyrics on ya
I be stealth like a B-52 bomber
Yeah, and y'all know I'ma make it hella fly
Like a plane stewardess, I take it to the sky
Hold up, I'm stayin' on some fly shit
In the cockpit, callin' me the pilot
When I drop the bar, they 'bout to enjoy this
Said I'm flyin' the plane, I got the joystick
It's for your enjoyment
Yeah, I got lyrics in the stash
Got you terrified like a plane that's 'bout to crash
Hold up, and every time I'm spittin' the sound
I treat these rappers like planes, I got 'em hittin' the ground
Let's go, ay, yeah, I got the bomb vocals
Get to poppin' the collar up on your polo
Over heads like a airplane, I'm the number one flower
'Bout to run 'em over with the mower
What, y'all know I got the fly vocals
Get to poppin' the collar up on your polo
Over heads like a airplane
I'm the number one flower
Check it, aight, listen, one more verse
Ay, everybody out there really know I'm the bomb
I be cuttin' rappers down like I was mowin' my lawn
Yeah, you know that I keep the lyrics up in the stash
Said I'm cuttin' rappers down, I'm 'bout to treat 'em like grass
Yeah, hold u', and I got the vibe you know I'm crazy with
All these lyrics, I keep it clean like yard maintenance
Doin' what I gotta do, you know it's not no drag
They be cuttin' down the grass, then they throw it in the bag
Hold up, and lyrics, I'm really 'bout to push 'em in
The homie said somethin', so you was shushin' him
Lookin' to the side like, "Be quiet!...
...'Cause this dude really kickin' a lyrical riot!"
I'm the flyest like the plane when I'm flowin' off the [brain]
Said I'm fancy like the polo shirt doin' work, leavin' rappers hurt
Ayo, I'm killin' these raps
Go ahead and tell me how you feel about that

[[B]]
Einstein when I kick a rhyme
AKA, Harry Mack smart
Ay, every time that I rhyme, it's like I'm fillin' up the canvas
This is my art
C'mon, I'm about to hold it down with the god flow
Rap artists, they compare me to Picasso
First name Pablo, illest, yeah, I thought so
I ain't never stop, though
H-Mack, 'bout to wake 'em up whenever I'm in it, they sayin', "No way!"
I'ma fill the canvas up like I was Monet
Yeah, and you know that you see 'im
They gon' prolly hang me up on the walls o' the museum
H-Mack goin' the hardest, you know they hungry, I'm starvin'
I told you when it comes to rappin', Harry Mack is a artist
I'm never slippin', I stay up in it, infinite, never timid
And any competition, I'ma win it
Let's go, artistic, creative
Ay, you rappers ain't relatin'
Ay, I'ma kill 'em if they hatin'
I'm the greatest in the game, no debatin'
Ay, rappers prolly need to stay the hell home
And my lyrics stay connected like a cell phone
Ay, for me to rap, it ain't no hard stuff
Like a cell phone with good service, I get my bars up
Ay, y'all know we connected like T-Mobile
I'ma blow your mind with these sweet vocals
Matter fact, I'm connected like Verizon
Risin', kinda like the sun at the horizon
Vibin', improvisin', never writin', no need for scribin'
H-Mack survivin' in these times 'cause I double up my work
Any time I kick a lyric, they about to go berserk
Yeah, y'all know I'm ready to flex
Pull out my cell phone and send you a text
We 'bout to make this shit happen, don't fail
Leavin' my message like it's a voice mail
But I leave my message live through these raps
That I be touchin' on top o' these tracks
H-Mack, goin' in it, flow infinite, never fallin' off
When it come to lyrics, y'all know I'm a boss
Let's go, I be goin' deep with my thoughts
Ay, until my brain gets caught
Yeah, y'all know I come through to create
Deep-ass thoughts that keep me up late
I be really in my brain goin' deep
So many thoughts that I can't even sleep
Think about the future, y'all know it's so amazin'
But now I can't calm down 'cause my brain's racin'
Too many thoughts, million miles a minute
That's why freestyle competition, I'ma win it
But, yo, sometimes it holds me back
I'm like, Mack, you gotta let go o' that
There's all these thoughts in my brain, so heavy I can levitate
Maybe I just need to take a moment, I can meditate
Get rid o' the thoughts and I can clear out my whole mental
Man, I think I gotta do it, man, I figure it's essential
Gotta find a way to get rid o' the thoughts that's cloudin' up my brain
Whenever I be on it, man, you know my flow is so untame, I'm insane
The way that I be flippin' it off o' the top o' the mental
You know that my flow goes in ya, Harry Mack 'bout to win ya
Live on Omegle, represent for my people
Yeah, this is the one and only shot, there ain't no sequel
Come on, y'all know that we 'bout to get them views, dude
Ay, is it cool if I post this on YouTube?


[[C]]
I be shinin' like a fixture
I be rhymin' while you start drawin' the picture
Yeah, doin' lyrics right up off the mental
They be drawin' with the pencil
Yeah, and I be the inspiration
I'ma blow up in this game, dawg, by every indication
So let's get it poppin'
Ayo, these rappers got no options
Somethin' like geologist 'cause Mack is steady rockin'
Yeah, and y'all know I go harder 'cause I'm fly
They comin' with the picture and they startin' with the eyes
Yeah, ayo, you know I help you see
When it comes to lyricism, I be gettin' hella free
My skills is infinite, at first I was kinda timid
I said, How long is it 'bout to take? They said, "Seven minutes."
Yeah, we goin' in, I'ma let my flow again
Ay, I ain't never losin', y'all know I'm supposed to win
Ain't nobody dope as him
I be shinin' bright
All up in the mix, ya see that Harry Mack is rhymin' tight
Hip hop, I'ma run it forever
I love to see the way the arts really comin' together
That's one line at a time, kinda like my rhymes when I shine, feelin' like Einstein
I'm prime, divine, sublime, etc., pick yo' synonym
Any competition, y'all know Mack be winnin' them
Ay, sweeter than cinnamon, y'all know I spit it pure
I'm a lion in the industry so watch me roar
Ay, y'all know I really put it on ya
Said I'm roarin' like a lion, wait, I'm roarin' like a monster
Yeah, I'm roarin' at the moon 'n shit
I'm really 'bout to do this shit
These other rappers in the game is stuck up on the clueless shit
Never Mack, though, I'm roarin', I'm the big dog
Any time they comin' for my throne, they got me pissed off
Ay, listen up, man, you know I got the drive
Ay, fillin' up with adrenaline, 'bout to dive
Through the sky, homie, I'm about to jump out the plane
I be stormin' on y'all and my thunder's insane
Yeah, ayo, every time I spit, man, I come with those emcee vibes
I'ma grab a single word, then I do a deep dive
Ay, y'all know I be rappin' my purpose
I'm divin', then I'm really crackin' the surface
I'm goin' deep in the water, deeper than oceanic
I'm makin' you panic, thoughts up in the brain is so frantic
Yeah, and y'all know these rappers really need to stay off
Life is hella hectic but I'm divin' through the chaos
Ay, I arrive and get free
Ay, peace to all the fans that are divin' with me
They follow along for the journey
Rappers claim they spittin' fire but they never burn me
Yo, when they 'bout to learn, G?
Ay, and y'all know I'm 'bout to strike
Yo, you drawin' my favorite part right now, it's the mic
'Cause that's the tool I use, I'm ready to move with lyrics that's smooth
And daily I'm about to improve, I'm ready to strike
I said you can say it out loud, they choosin' to type
Okay, that's cool, these words are all my type
I'm here to break 'em down swiftly, rappers, they don't get me
I be animated just like Disney, gettin' busy
Y'all know that we havin' fun
Said on a daily basis, I be goin' on a run
Well, I'd say prob'ly nine outta ten days
I'm tryna make it a habit, tryna be a sensei
Of my own physical health, one foot in front the other
Yeah, that's the way that we be buildin' with each other
Hold up, I said I'm rockin' in the virtualest digital
But I be tryna stay focused on workin' out my physical
Yeah, people love the way I'm flexin' live
I deep dive while I'm workin' on my exercise
Hold up, nobody like me
When I grab the mic, I'm 'bout to strike with the free
Strappin' on my Nikes
So that I can get to runnin', man, I'm 'bout to let the thunder clap
I be trackin' my progress on the runnin' app
Checkin' out my route, y'all know what I'm about
I spew and I spout, I brainstorm even in droughts
Yeah, and y'all know that I get raw for the year
Ay, shout to the homie who be drawin' my beard
Yeah, it's comin' together, I'm runnin' it better
Whenever it's comin' to lyrics, they know that I'm clever
I told you I'm masterful just like Shredder
Ya better check it, reckless when I be spittin' on the soul sample
I drop heavy like a whole anvil
Yeah, next beat
Unh, y'all know I'm 'bout to bring the heat
Yeah, hold u', next groove
Yeah, y'all know we makin' major moves
Ay, makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Ay, we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Ay, we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Ay, we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Hold up, I'm doin' my part, that's right when it starts
I'm ready to spark, they doin' they art
They drawin' they pic, they know that I'm sick, I think of it quick
I be the top pick, I be the top choice
I'm speakin' my voice, my lyrics is moist
My lyrics is wet, I'm pressin' a threat
They wonder who's best, they placin' they bets
I'm reppin' the west, I come from the coast
We doin' the most, I brag and I boast
My lyrics feroc', you might overdose
I'm killin' 'em dead when up in the head
The code, it is red, it's an emergency, certainly
Rappers never be hurtin' me, over head like a turban be
When I wear it out
Ay, I'm lookin' for somethin' new I can blare it out
Yeah, ayo, I gotta speak it, y'all know I ain't got no weakness
So peep this, I got the deepest
Yeah, ayo, ya know I put it down the sweetest, somethin' like candy
They blind to my rhymes, they can't see
Mack, I'm goin' in, really 'bout to win
Roar like a lion, I ain't got no twin
Take a deep dive on a lyrical run
I'm grabbin' words from the homie and I'm straight havin' fun
Hold u', we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Hold u', we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
No doubt, we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Hold u', we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Hold u', yeah, I said the moves we make are major
We shock you just like a taser
Y'all know that I'm 'bout to fade ya the fuck up out the game now
I come through with that insane style
You know that I'm 'bout to flame out
Whenever I'm on it, I'm keepin' it honest, and that is a promise
I won't let go of it, I'm flowin' sick
You gon' overdose in this, do the most in this
Yeah, unh, comin' through with all o' the phat raps
Yeah, peace to the homie that drawin' my face and my snapback
Ay, drawin' the hat with the detail
No, my flow is not available for resale
You know we 'bout to prevail
It's for the male and female
All in between, 'cause however you identify
You gonna remember that I send a fly
Lyric off the tip, sky-high like 747
I might chill on a cloud up in heaven
I get high like Snoop Dogg and Devin
I be preachin' like I'm the reverend
Throw it down, the golden crown atop my head, I'll rock 'til dead
Until my coffin drops into the dirt deep in the earth
I'm givin' birth to every verse, it's unrehearsed
They got the hat comin' together, yo, I'm seein' it clear
H-Mack, I'ma free up in here
Yeah, everywhere I'm steppin', I'ma leave a field o' dead clones
Right now they be drawin' out the band for my headphones
Ay, makin' major moves, makin' major moves
C'mon, we makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Let's go, makin' major moves, makin' major moves
You gon' see me once, see me twice, like it's déjà vu
C'mon, makin' major moves, makin' major moves
Hold up, I'm 'bout to shock you kinda like a taser, dude
Hold up, I be precise, kinda like a laser, dude
You gon' see me once, see me twice, call it déjà vu

We turnin' up in here, 2021'll be the fuckin' year
Let's go, ay, we turnin' up in here
Ay, kill the game like it's nothin' here
Ay, yeah, and my vision stay clear, 2021'll be the fuckin' year
Ay, we gon' do it right now
Ay, currently, they focused on the eyebrows
Ay, every time I rhyme, they gettin' hyphy
This is crazy, man, it's really lookin' like me
Harry Mack, it might be
Yeah, y'all know I adjust your whole psyche
Just do it, somethin' like Nike
I'ma earn the check, I be catchin' wreck every time I flex, I'm up next
What did y'all expect? I'm who they cannot detect
I'm off the radar, stay far away from y'all
Keep it honest 'cause I didn't come to play with y'all
Yeah, and I'm doin' what I have to do
Before you step to battle, dude, you take some time to master you
You gotta look up in the mirror, face all your fears, I'm makin' it clear
I'm sharper than spear, I'm 'bout to hit ya all up in the ear hole
Be fearful, here go, another rhyme for y'all
I think it's time for y'all to throw it down
Turn it up in here
Ay, 2021 gon' be the fuckin' year
Let's go, ay, we turnin' up in here
We about to kill the game like it's nothin' here
Let's go, my lyrics might just crush your ears
Yeah, we be really turnin' up in here
Let's go, ay, we turnin' up in here
Hold up, ay, we turnin' up in here
Yeah, to draw a face like this, that be a challenge
Shout to the artist 'cause you really got the talent
Yeah, I swear to god you drawin' me the best
In fact, I feel blessed that you made this request
You workin' on the nose while I'm cookin' up the flows
Makin' rappers overdose, I'm the one they really chose
Harry Mack gon' do the most, got the beard
Comin' together, I run it forever
Whenever I'm spittin', the Mack is never just quittin'
You know that I'm really gon' hit 'em
I'm bringin' the rhythm whenever I come off the tip o' this
Bars are ridiculous, better be followin' me
Yeah, rappers thinkin' somehow they'll be swallowin' me?
Ay, never gon' happen whenever I'm snappin', I'm lockin' in
Ay, rockin' once, I'm rockin' twice, and then I rock again, three times is the charm
Ay, I'm reachin' out with the arm
Ay, y'all know I'm keepin' it calm
Ay, I'm blowin' up like a bomb
Ay, I got the lyrics for days, I truly amaze
You know that I'm leavin' 'em blazed whenever I'm lightin' 'em up
The lyrics that I be providin', they be tighter than fuck
Ay, let me go and grab it
I be the lyrical addict
Reactin' like a fuckin' savage
Y'all know I'm above the average
I got dynamics, I'm 'bout to slam it, I'm makin' rappers go panic
Go harder than the motherfuckin' granite, god damn it
Where will it land?
Ay, I get vicious over tracks
You know my rhymes might even kill a man
Ayo, this picture right here is on point
Harry Mack, I gotta stretch how I rock in the long joint
Let's go!
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
[Ayo, this might have to be the last beat, man!]
[This is lookin' crazy, bro! It really looks like me! This is amazing, let's go.]
Aight, but yo, okay, uh-uh
Off the top, you know I'm cookin' a free
Got the picture really ill, man, it's lookin' like me
Can't believe it, ayo, the imagery comin' clear
And when I look at your Omegle screen, it's just like a mirror
'Cause it's reflectin' my image, my flow is not finished
I'm never timid, competition, I'm 'bout to win it
Yeah, ayo, it's really lookin' proper
I got you twisted like you takin' shots o' vodka
Either that or shots o' gin
Ay, ay, I'm shinin' bright, I'm never dim
Ay, ay, Harry Mack, they know 'bout him
Ay, when I finish stylin', I smile with a grin
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I got them good vibes, keep it positive
All my people 'round the planet gotta live, so I gotta give
My heart and soul in this
Ayo, this planet, man, I'm not really controllin' this
But my destiny, I can manifest it, G
So I close my eyes, and then I get what I request with ease
Yeah, fillin' in the details o' the mic
Ay, y'all know that I'm rockin' males and females on the mic
Ay, ay, ay, talkin' 'bout my real life experience, they gon' hear me when-
Ever I'm droppin', you know that they fallin' off like leaves in autumn
They droppin' from off o' the branch
Steppin' to me, you better have the firmest stance
Otherwise you will be takin' a chance, way too advanced
Ay, fillin' it in
Ay, rappers know that I'm really 'bout to kill 'em again
Yeah, I be comin' in swiftly, it's over if they dis me
Shoulda known it, freestyle, the dope component
Yeah, and y'all know that my flow is not simplistic
They be drawin' with the pencil and they keepin' it artistic
Unh, and when they do the picture, they bring mad heat
I had to send the warnin' like this might have to be last beat
Yeah, ayo, but I can't move on 'til the picture is complete
'Cause it's lookin' too strong
Yeah, and y'all know I could do it whether it's the high or sober vibe
I just had to kick it into overdrive
Yeah, and out the game, the Mack is runnin' you
I don't need no pencil but I'm still gon' take a number 2
On the industry because I'm shittin' on the game
Spittin' lead from the head with the rhythm that's insane
Hold up, meanin' that these words are like bullets from out my mental nine
Yeah, I just use the only weapon, it's my mind
That's the only one that I be packin'
My skills is stackin' and can't nobody do it like the Mack'n
I'm classic like Cadillackin' on the big rims
Ay, rappers step to me, they turn to victims
Yeah, and y'all know that I be doin' this to rock out right now
You be drawin' pictures of the shock mount
Holdin' the mic in place so that it don't rumble
Even when I win, ya know I keep it on the humble
Rappers steppin' incorrect to Mack, they 'bout to stumble
I can't hold it in, I grab the mic and then I unload
One minute left on the beat, it's almost over now
Y'all know that I'm comin' through the break through like Red Rover now
I'ma show ya how, I be doin' me
I'm kickin' lyrics fluidly
There ain't nobody out there who is schoolin' me
The details lookin' proper, I'm droppin' logic, I rock it
Yeah, never forgot about the one that kicks it like soccer ball and scorin' the goal
Yeah, ayo, I'm crushin' any microphone I hold
I be shinin' like the gold
Hold u', yeah, I'm off the head and it's clear
I dig the way you even got the red in my beard
Yeah, check it, y'all know my grind up on the mic is tireless
Got the red in my beard to remind 'em that I'm Irish
I'm here for y'all, ayo, we changin' every policy
They got the mic drawn correctly with the technology
Yeah, I said I be lyrically blazin'
It looks just like me, the picture is amazin'
Hold up, y'all know that Mack is spittin' through the drama
You actually drew me perfectly and I'm honored
Yeah, y'all know I get it crackin' like the snare
Right on time, we 'bout to end it right there
