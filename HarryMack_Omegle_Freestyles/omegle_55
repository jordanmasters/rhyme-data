[[A]]
All o' my lyrics are fatal, rappers should probably lay low
When it be comin' to kickin' the verse, I build mine from the dirt like potatoes
Unh, I'm goin' in, unh, y'all know I always been this guy
Unh, y'all know I'm takin' these rappers and turnin' 'em into some French fries
Yeah, I'm doin' me, unh, killin' the game for goodness's sake
I keep it real and I never been fake
Potatoes out oven, these beats gettin' baked
Unh, Mack, I go in it to win it, y'all know I come with the verse in style
Unh, shout to potatoes, that is a food that is so versatile
Unh, y'all know we 'bout to bring the cash in
Shout to my man with the LEDs flashin'
H-Mack, man, I never spit the dead stuff
I told you that you got a bomb setup
Yeah, I'm about to do it like none other
You hit the button, then you got the lights changin' colors
Mack, when I'm on it, I'm about to get the reward
Lights goin' crazy on wall and the keyboard
Yeah, and you know I be spittin' it hype
I said, "Dawg, you got a pretty sick mic!"
Yeah, when I'm on it, I be dominant
I was like, "Dude, it's dope, just take the compliment!"
I be comin' off the top 'cause there ain't nobody like me
I'ma just do it like NIKE®
Yeah, I see that all up on your sweatshirt
Rappers steppin' up to Harry Mack is 'bout to get hurt
Microphone, I'm controllin' it
And I could tell that you're mouthin', "Holy shit!"
I'm about to do my thing and these rappers get bitter
I get bigger from the post up on Twitter
Unh, I get fly in the place
And I seen the flag for Ohio State
H-Mack, every time I'm on it, never been a wack clown
I'm about to push emcees to the background
I be blowin' your mind when flowin' divine, I'm really goin' in
Every time I rhyme, I'ma win
I'm about to make your head spin like merry-go
Spread like venereal when Harry flow
Unh, I'ma get across the planet, all my lyrics are gigantic
Make you panic when I'm on it, it gets frantic
Man, I take it to the highest place all up in the game
Rappers 'bout to run and hibernate, man, my shit's insane
Do what I feel and you know that I embarrass ya
Can't write my flows in 140 characters
Yeah, it's too big for a tweet
Unh, H-Mack gettin' sick on the beat
Unh, all o' my lyrics are vital
I post it on Twitter, it's 'bout to go viral
And everyone knowin' H-Mack is a bigger threat
I'm 'bout to be seen across the whole internet
Yeah, I'm 'bout to get it, yup
Unh, that much is guaranteed
Unh, when I be finished, yup
Unh, rappers need therapy
Come off the top and these rappers get stuck
Unh, I need some drank in my cup
Yeah, y'all know we fillin' it up
Beats and verses, we killin' that stuff
Unh, y'all know I'm ready to smash
Shouts to the cup but I need a glass
Why? 'Cause it's about to get smashed!
Pick up the shard, then I'm cuttin' your ass
Unh, Mack, when I'm on it, man, I make ya relax
Like ya got the Cabernet in the wine glass
Unh, heh, every time I grip up on the mic, you know I smash
I'ma get my cash
Unh, H-Mack, y'all know I can do it high or sober
Yeah, I kill this shit, that's why my cup runneth over
Unh, everything I do is way too gigantic
My videos like World Cup, watched around the planet
Unh, and y'all know we goin' in
Any competition, Harry Mack is really 'bout to win
Pullin' mics up out my cupboard, Harry Mack flowin' divine
Every time I hop on Omegle to rhyme
Man, y'know the kid is blowin' yo' mind

[[B]]
I got the flows that they cherish, other rappers should be embarrassed
I'm hangin' by the Eiffel Tower, took a trip out to Paris
Unh, steppin' up to me, they don't stand a chance
'Cause my fans span from the U.S. out to France
Yeah, I kill it casual, my moves are so tactical
They bump me out in Paris, France, I'm so international
Unh, thinkin' you better than Mack, that ain't common sense
When I die, they'll build a Eiffel Tower, make me a monument
Yeah, y'all know my flow so texturized
Like the Eiffel Tower, I'm globally recognized
Yeah, and y'all know I'm out here rappin'
I got your body movin' like the flag steady flappin'
At the top o' Eiffel, I'm bustin' off the top like rifle
Yeah, I been killin' it since second-grade recital
Unh, I'm in the session straight-up bangin' with the noise
I said, "What's goin' on?" They said, "Hangin' with the boys!"
Yeah, all up out the area I'm runnin' ya
Peace to all the homies who be chillin' in Colombia
I'm 'bout to make it thunder, bruh
Y'all know that I'm 'bout to spit it raw
It's Mack, I really kill this with no flaw
Yeah, I'm doin' me off the top, spittin' it fluidly, yes, it's true indeed
Ain't nothin' that these other rappers really do to me
Unh, they steppin' stupidly so I gotta put 'em all back in they place
Unh, kick raps all out o' my face, no disgrace, y'all get laced
Harry Mack ain't been a drag yet
Ayo, I'm gettin' to the bread, baguettes
Unh, y'all love the way that I be shinin'
I need them big baguettes, I'm talkin' 'bout diamonds
Then again, who am I kiddin' or foolin', G?
'Cause I look hella foolish rockin' shiny jewelry
I gotta keep it true to me, that's a fact, though
Ayo, I'm comin' right off o' the top with the rap flow
I get the baguettes, hold up, wait, that's French bread
I bring it back to Eiffel Tower when I spit it off the head
Unh, bread and butter, my bread and butter is flippin' flows
Yeah, leave a permanent imprint, they can't get rid o' those
Eatin' these rappers up like crumpets
When I'm improvisin', I feel like Miles Davis on the trumpet
Yeah, so please prepare, H-Mack, check how long I last
I'ma grip up on the trumpet, then I improvise some jazz
Yeah, and I keep the speakers blarin'
Damn, that's a dope shirt, art by Keith Haring
Yeah, I come right off the top, y'all know I got mellow plans
I can see the pink background with the yellow man
Jumpin', it's nothin', y'all know I never fail
Pink background, pink cap, and a pink whale
On your phone case, pink everywhere across the screen
I see pink in three places at once, it's a theme
I been killin' mics from the start
I am not a actor playin' no part
On your shirt, you got the heart with the eyes, I see from my heart
They idolize how I do this raw emceein' art
I take to skies, I be liftin' off, they be filmin' on they phones
Every time that I'm rappin', you know that I'm goin' so deep in the zone
Can't leave it alone
Y'all know I'm eatin' a rapper's dome just like it's a scone
From out o' the bakery
Never once have I been a fake emcee
It's taken me too long to get my point across in the industry
So I hop on Omegle and do it instantly
I'm blessed to be goin' wild in the place
From LA to Colombia, puttin' smiles on they face

I get started, I don't hesitate to put this on ya
I'm scarin' emcees, I'm a freakin' monster
H-Mack, I'm different, I'm bringin' the remedies
I'm quick to wake you up like you sippin' Monster Energy®
Unh, I spit it sweeter than a cookie, fam
I be scarin' all these mo'fuckers like the boogeyman
They think they on my level, they don't come close
If I wasn't a monster, then I guess I'm a ghost
Then again, nah, 'cause I gotta survive
I couldn't really be a ghost when I spit this live
H-Mack, y'all know that it's the foulest scene
It's October, it's gettin' close to Halloween
So we gotta rap about it when on this shit
Ayo, these lyrics I'm deliverin' are monsterous
Unh, and y'all know that we be gettin' to the mean cash
Scarin' rappers, woulda thought I had a Halloween mask
Unh, ayo, I'm doin' it different
And when it comes to kickin' lyrics, I be way too persistent
Yeah, these rappers lame, unh, these rappers fake, y'all
So if they steppin' up to me, yo, that takes balls
H-Mack, man, you know that I'm arousin'
The crowd when I'm kickin' all the lyrics that's astoundin'
I'm spittin' on the corner, party people are surroundin'
Lyrics like a basketball, that's the way they bouncin'
Over instrumentals while I dribble with saliva
Compared to all my competitors, I be gettin' liver
Kick it like a soccer ball, swing like a golf ball
Knock it out the park, my lyric is too evolved, y'all
Unh, y'all know I spit it with flair
I work hard, yo, I keep a lot o' balls in the air
H-Mack, man, I'm goin' over heads like a bald spot
And I was killin' mics since before my balls dropped
Unh, pay attention, y'all know I spit exclusively
That's right, I was rhymin' even pre-puberty
Unh, and back then, I would get punked
With the prepubescent voice, rappin' like a chipmunk
High pitch, yo, I switch, Harry Mack, I ride this
All up on the mic swift, ain't nobody like this
Yeah, you know my lyrics top choice
They like, "For real, yo, he switched to a high-pitched voice!"
I'ma make it happen every single time that I get hype
Shout the girl in the background with the red and white stripes
H-Mack, I'm doin' it, can't play with the sound
I said, "What y'all doin'?" They said, "We just layin' around!"
I spit with passion, takin' action, I'm never clashin'
When I call out what you wearin', yo, I got you laughin'
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, my flow, they can't erase this
Wait, you got a red shirt and a red bracelet?
You got it matched together, I rap forever
Every time I kick a lyric over tracks, it's clever
Yeah, I do it for y'all, I'm spittin' this ‘mistle’
Every time I'm rhymin', I be shinin' like crystals
Yeah, it's Harry Mack, they love how I'm rhymin'
I be shinin' like the crystals or I'm shinin' like diamonds
Yeah, you said crystals, it makes sense I'ma wreck this
Can tell you like shiny things just by yo' necklace
Yeah, and if they steppin' incorrect, they gon' get hurt
You got the shiny necklace over top the gray sweatshirt
I do my thing when I'm live on beat
What was the last word? Pretty sure you said it was feet!
Is that right? H-Mack, I kick flows!
Feel it from your head all the way down to your toes
H-Mack, y'all know that I can't even front
When I rhyme, go, like, a thousand feet at once
I'm spannin' for miles, y'all know they 'bout to need a long-ass ruler
To measure me 'cause I'm cooler
It's H-Mack, I spit it with the craziest flair
Yo, the whole time I been rappin', you been playin' with you hair

[[E]]
All o' these rappers, they know that I'm ill I got the flavors they crave
Ooh, all o' these rappers be tryin' to surf They wanna ride on my wave, ride on my wave
Unh, every time that I'm spittin', y'all know that I'm vital
Ay, shout out to big-ass waves, ay, I'm goin' viral on Tidal
Ay, y'all know I hit you just like a tsunami
It's Harry Mack, I got flavor like umami
I told you I'm killin' shit, word to my mommy
And y'all know I'm grabbin' the mic with the bomb frees
I come off the tip o' this, bars are ridiculous Everyone duckin' too low
Ay, word to the ocean waves motherfuckers surfin' on Y'all know Harry Mack got the flow
Ay, come off the tip and I'm makin' rappers panic
I be goin' deep, kinda like the oceanic
I be runnin' frantic, ain't really a challenge
Like I'm on a surfboard how I keep my balance
Yeah, y'all know that I'm droppin' hella facts
Smooth like a surfboard when it got the wax
H-Mack, y'all know I'm 'bout to play my part
Scare y'all like a surfer when they see a shark
H-Mack, y'all know I came through to rap
I'ma scare you dead like a shark attack
Anytime I'm rhymin', they know I'm about to win
I'ma crack the surface kinda like a shark fin
I never fail, these rappers be havin' to bail, they jump off they surfboards
They know I'm king, I'm out here doin' my thing, call me the verse lord
I break it down, people be lovin' the sound Y'all know we out here gettin' paid
Kinda like the glasses you got up on your face Harry Mack is out here throwin' rappers shade
Yeah, I'ma do it kinda like this, every time I rhyme, other rappers got beef
Shouts to the homie who be reppin' in the bucket hat I'ma get you higher than the pot leaves
Yeah, Mack, I be callin' what I'm seein'
Never write it down 'cause I'd rather be freein'
Unh, they ain't in the same zone he's in
Ooh, lyrics so cold they freezin'
Unh, wait, then again... every time I rhyme, I be rockin' shit
I don't wanna say that my lyrics is freezin', I would rather hit you with the opposite
Now, you might wonder why I don't really wanna be frozen
See, rather than that, I would rather be hot Man, I think that the flames should be chosen
See, if I go to the flames and the fire and blaze up your entire stuff
Well, that would give me a nice transition to start rappin' 'bout fire trucks
I'm goin' in, I got emcees flinchin'
Better call me in like a fire engine
Harry Mack, y'all know I get live when cypherin'
I get wet like a fire hydrant
Ay, I spit the cleanest raps
I can tell you dig it 'cause you leanin' back
Harry Mack, y'all know that they want mo'
Had you leanin' back, you was straight-up horizontal
Unh, y'all know I'm doin' all the shit that these other rappers cannot do
Ay, rappers is fake as fuck, I'm 'bout to wake 'em up, kinda like your Mtn Dew®
Yeah, Mack, when I'm doin' what I feel, I'ma put my words together in a hurry
Unh, spit so fast that it's blurry, shout to the homie in the cap that's furry
Ay, Mack goin' off, I'm 'bout to win
I'm 'bout to show them all once again
We had surfin', then we had fire truck
Harry Mack, man, you know that I'm high as fuck
I be tryin' to remember what the third word was
Someone hit me so I can just bust
["Walmart!"] That's right, I'm smart
Matter fact, rappers corporate like Walmart
Harry Mack, I'ma break you off with more
I be hard to the core, word to Walmart stores
But then again, every time I rhyme off the brain
I ain't Walmart 'cause I stay off the chain
Yeah, I ain't a chain, I'm one-to-one
When it comes to rhymin', Harry Mack gon' get it done
Yeah, y'all know I flow how I'm s'pposed to be
Unh, they hit up Walmart for groceries
Unh, grip on the mic and I spark it
I'm never at Walmart, I'm hittin' the Target
Yeah, breakin' down names o' the shoppin' centers
Got the hottest embers, they will not remember
Any other rapper, I'ma smother rappers
I be underground, I'm a undercover rapper
I'll blackout whenever I'm spittin'
Harry Mack, off top, his freestylin' sounds written
Let's go!
