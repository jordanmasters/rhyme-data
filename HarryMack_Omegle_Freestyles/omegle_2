Yeah, Uh, Yeah
C’mon, ay, c’mon, ay, c’mon, ay, c’mon, ay
For most these rappers it’s hopeless Cuz mack is the dopest
My name spreading all across the planet like COVID
When you listenin’ you gon have a fun time
I said my rhyme contagious like it’s COVID the 1-9
Nineteen on the rhyme scene when I spit it
They talked about doing it but I went and did it
Yeah, when it comes to rapping Harry Mack the top pick
I don’t have the COVID but my lyrics are sick
Yeah I gots to be the most clean on the rap scene
I’m so sick with it they be working on vaccines
They tryna stop me. Yall know I’m up to the task
Don’t get close to my raps unless you wearing a mask
I’m on a whole ‘nother plane when I flow off the brain
I hold it down on my court, this rap shit is my sport
Get ya twisted like vodka each time that I rock ya
Lyrics yo I’m just kicking em, like it was soccer
I’m on another plane, rappers I’ma laugh at yall
Through the legs then I hit the dunk like it’s basketball
Uh who can stop me? It’s all good y’all
I’ma score the touchdown, this is lyrical football
But I don’t need no gear, and I don’t need no helmet
I’m going at em raw with the lyrics that sound well writ
But these are off the top, the fact I will report this
She’s pulling out her phone like ‘I need to record this’
Yeah these bars they be hotter than a kiln
Right now I’m up on your iPhone film
It’s Harry Mack y’all just be lovin the vibe
Don’t film for too long you’ll fill up your hard drive
You gon’ use all your data All these rappers don’t matter
I’m the mad hatter, I’m making MCs shatter
Dropping all these skills and I came to get ill
Every time I open up y’all know my thoughts are revealed
Okay. I’m the real deal, other rappers are wannabes;
When they spittin bars I'm laughing. I figure it’s comedy
It’s Harry Mack, I do it man, my lyrics have been raw
No I’m not a comedian, but I do improv
Yeah, and y’all know that I really got the fly shit
I’m bossin', she be sayin’ this guy’s awesome
I bet when I said I rap you figured I would be fucking boring
But now I’m all live on your story Uh, You know I don’t need no facade
She’s covering up her mouth and saying ‘Oh my god’
And now she’s got her hand covering like both her eyes
Yeah everybody notice I got dopest vibes
Yeah grip up on the mic and then I’m ready to rearrange ya
I had to get down on Omegle You know I’m connecting to strangers
From all across the planet Doin’ the shit that I be feeling
Heart and soul that’s what I’m revealing
When I be on it you know that I'm killing
I’m coming right off of the top of the head
I’m leaving my enemies dead
I really dig your iPhone I can see that it’s red
She got her hand up, you know that I bang in the place
Yo I did the double time and then she made the stank face
Come on, every time that I be flowing it’s rare
Yeah, hey yo, lyrically I grow like your hair
I’m doing my thing It’s Harry Mack you know I’ma sting
And every time I rhyme you know i’m bout to shine like your rings
It’s Harry Mack!

[[B]]

I’m about to kill the game, everyone can trust me
I be carrying my weight like huskies
I be kicking more lyrics off the head
‘Till the day i’m dead I’mma pull my weight like a sled
Dog moving through the fog, I’m moving past ya
Yo my flow is cold, like huskies in Alaska
Yeah, I’m coming off top with words
And my lyrics so pure, y’all are soft like the fur
On the husky, I bust free, I kill shit just trust me
And there’s no one in the world could adjust me
I trust myself, I do what I will
I come right off the top of the brain I always be feeling the skill
Ah can’t no one stop me, I'm about to get it, most probably
I got the hot free yeah, but I be iced like coffee
Harry Mack, you know I turn art up
I'm addictive like iced coffee from Starbucks
Yeah, I be representing with a live crew
It's coronavirus so I gotta hit the drive-thru
Come off the tip, you know I'm spitting it nice
You know I'm pouring the coffee
Then I'ma fill it with ice
It's waking me up, I got the caffeine
Hey yo they loving my styles, I be the rap fiend
I'm really killing this, Mack they can't fuck with that
All my lyrics going over heads like a bucket hat
They think they hard, I think hardly
I'm in my bucket hat, I'm exploring the safari
All these lyrics that I kick you know that they mean rare
Shout my girl in the yellow shirt with the green hair
Yeah yo I get ill in the zone
Peace to my man on the other couch who films on the phone
Yeah I said “How you doing?” She said “Chilling, I'm just getting by
Sitting on my front porch in Ohio getting high”
Now I’m spitting fly, I'm here to demonstrate
Know when it comes to rhymes, I really innovate
Peace to my new friends, y'all my new people
I'm kicking ill bars while I'm rocking on Omegle

[[C]]

Hey yo I'm waking them up
Most these rappers asleep
Most these rappers in the sheets
They be counting them sheep
Every time I rhyme I'm dropping them words
No I'm not a sheep, but I'm the one that you heard
Yeah, Mack on another level, I'm going ham
Most these rappers they be softer than the fur of a lamb
Yeah, yo when it comes to lyrics I'm better
My bars are clever, I'mma herd all these rappers like shepherd
I'm doing my thing for certain, take y'all on a brain vacation
I'll be plugging in just like Playstation
Yeah I'll run you over, breaking through like it's red rover
And I be lyrical soldier, I be gripping the controller
This is Playstation, Spyro I come with the live flow
Rappers stepping up to me; they'll never have survival
Yeah I'm bout to get it, when I be rhyming I'm going full throttle
Lyrically yes I will be a role model
And I'll be sipping it out of the bottle
Come for the liquor, it's making you sicker
I'm thinking much quicker, I'm pulling the trigger
Y'all you know that I'm going right off of the tip with this
Bars that I’m dropping they way too ridiculous
Yeah, you know that I’m coming with the ammo
I go over heads kinda like your orange camo
Mack all up in it and I'm shining too bright
I said my lyrics changing colors kind of like your room lights
Yeah I'm all up on it getting lively man
I see up in the upper left you got the iVCam
H-Mack ‘bout to slam, do it in a new way
I connect with my people out there in the UK
Yeah, ayo it's nothing, I'm fly
You be bugging from the lyrics and you rubbing your eyes
I'mma smash this just to change the game, that's what the task is
Cover your face and knocking off your glasses
Harry Mack I got them tripping when I'm busting
I change the game got these other lames readjusting

[[D]]

I'm never slackin’ I be doing my thing
I belong in the throne, Harry Mack is a king
Listen, every time I throw down with the sound
They recognize that my vibe be deserving a crown
I gotta have it, and lyrics imma bring some
All the people that surround me yeah that's my kingdom
Y'all couldn't float here on a boat
I said I'm building up my kingdom, I might need me a moat
I got the quotes, I'm dope
Y'all know that I'm tight, what
Every time I kick a bar I see his face light up
Nothing new about it cause you know i've been fresh
I'm a rapper, kinda like NF
Yeah but Harry Mack is the new dude
I'm not NF, but I am on YouTube
And word to NF cause I'm about to go up
When people talk shit on my name I give no fucks
That's NF, I respelled it
I got my own story yo the Mack’s bout to tell it
I gel with the instrumental when I drop reports
They feel me in LA and they feel me in New York
But it don't stop though, I really got the hot flow
They feel me in New York, and they feel me in Morocco
Yeah people out there is really loving it,
They said "Dawg but we got problems with the government"
I said "What do you mean? How does it seem?"
He said "Well, your human rights are our dreams"
Damn. That shit really hit me heavy
Honestly, it cut through my chest like a machete
I hope that y'all can find the freedom that you seek
I hope that y'all remain strong and never weak
I hope you find a way past it when I rock ya
But most importantly, I hope you always have vodka
Yeah Harry Mack I really press a bigger threat
I'm also blessed to know y'all got the cigarettes
It's all good man you living your life
Although the government has problems the people are nice
And that's what's up, so Mack coming through with the style
I'm going wild, I'm so happy I could make y'all smile
Come on, I really let my lyrics unfurl
After this flow I got fans all across the whole world
It's like that!
