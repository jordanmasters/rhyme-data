 Yeah, when I’m in your speakers, better keep that shit thumping
Peace to my brand new friends out of London
Rappers stepping to me I’ma make them my victim
I need a watch that be bigger than Big Ben
Mack all up on it check the way I deliver
I’m running straight through your city like a big ass river
Come on, ayo keep your system thumping kid
I brung the shit, get across like the London Bridge
H-Mack throwing down, when I’m on it I got style
Speaking of rivers most these rappers in denial (the nile)
Get it? Ayo I’m doing what I feel
Bars that I’m dripping off the top are hella real
I go up and down your spine like shivers, every time that I deliver
Pulling arrows out the quiver, I got more flow than a river
Check the way I do it yo, I rock till I’m dead
These two girls on Omegle, they be nodding their head
Yeah, ayo I’m coming off the top with the mean steez
Cheers to my girl sipping green tea
yeah I’m bout to rock again, yo you got to cop the one with antioxidants
It’s Harry Mack I’m all up on it, I tell you what I’m thinking
It’s green tea with antioxidants that’s what I’m drinking
Yeah, I’m getting love, I drink it out the mug
It’s not for the club it’s for Omegle we get love
Let’s do it, coming off the tip of this with off the head rhymes
I got you relaxing like sipping on some red wine
Ayo I’m filling all my enemies with more doubt
I’m popping off the top like I’m pulling the cork out (Whew)
It’s H-Mack my bars are more true
I spit more bars rappers get it twisted like a corkscrew
Ayo I’m running my campaign
Speaking of wine, my lyrics bubble just like the champagne
Doing what I’m feeling you know they want to cling right
I be shining like your background with the string lights
It's H-Mack man I’m doing what I gotta
I'm leading all my enemies directly to the slaughter
Yeah, they nodding their heads when I be spitting it right through the screen
Come off the top and I’m living my dream
I tell my people direct what I mean yeah
Other rappers be out there killing me
My new fans out in London be really feeling me.

[[B]]
When it comes to lyrics, you know I run it hard
Lyrical football, I’m running 100 yards
Scoring the touchdown, bringing the plush sound
Ayo I spike the football, I’m yelling what now
Ayo we winning, we getting all 7 points
I’m rocking these heaven joints
Lift ya higher with fire and they admire the way I’m scoring the field goal
Yeah it’s Mack, I’m bout to kick in the real soul uh
I’m coming after y’all, shout my man I’m supporting bruh
Cause he just committed to Florida
Yeah he’s bout to go out there for college
The hard work you put in it had to be acknowledged
Can’t be abolished, for my style they thank it
Peace out to my man who be nodding in the blanket
Mack you know my flow switch up your whole demeanor
He about to graduate cause he’s a high school senior
Putting in the hard work bout to get the freedom
When I’m done they going to spin it back for the rerun
Yeah ayo you know you about to stay out late
You going to be up at 2 am but it’s all great, no debate
Cause your mom ain’t about to tell you no
I be improvising kicking hella flows
Yeah I bring the realness and everyone can feel this
And that’s the reason why you pulled your phone out to film this
Yeah ayo you know this man’s crazed
Every time I spit I’m entering the fan cave
Read that on the poster, yeah I let the verse flame
You know in this competition I’ma win my first game
Uh I got the hardest flows
Mic abusing never losing to the Cardinals
Ayo I knew you had the skill set to show me
I should've known you played football from all your trophies
See em on the dresser, I put the game under pressure
I’m coming with all the lyrics them people can’t even measure
Yeah and y'all know I be busting it out
He had to put down his phone just to cover his mouth
H Mack, man I call out what I’m seeing when I smash this
Hold up I see my own reflection in your glasses
Mack getting down with the bars that are lethal
I be rocking for the fans while we out here on Omegle

[[C]]
Pulling off the flow like I’m pulling off a prank
Peace to people getting twisted when they sipping on they drank
Yeah, when I’m rhyming dog I’m iller than fuck
I’m ready for the drank, somebody get to filling my cup
I told you I’m nice, I drop the lyrics sure to entice
And if I’m pouring up my drink it better be on some ice
I’m ice cold, spit it quite bold, yes I got the hype soul
Ain’t no telling where I might go
Yeah, I’m about to hit them when I’m on it, I’m colder than Switzerland
I got new fans representing Western Michigan
All the bullshit, it's about to get abolished
That’s right I just acknowledged your motherfucking college
Harry Mack up on it, yo I spit so big
They said dawg I got a channel, it’s called SiscoKid
I said "what’s it like?" He said "Dog it’s sure to get you jumping"
We do some prank videos just like Danny Duncan
Alright I got to check it out as soon as we done
Uh, when I’m in the session I just spit from the tongue
C'mon, we gon keep it on, rapping with creations
I bleed from the brain, you can call it menstruation
Mack, I’m on it, styles I got a myriad
I’m the illest, menstruation, I’m the illest, PERIOD.
H-Mack, I put it down so eternally
Ain’t a rapper in the whole game who be burning me
I’ll be the greatest like Michael
When I be spitting there ain’t no survival
Matter fact kinda like menstruation
All of my lyrics be going through cycles
You know I’m old school, kinda like tribal, when I just flow off the brain
Uhh peace to the people that’s live on Omegle, they know that I’m going insane
Come off the tip of this, bars are ridiculous
You know I stay low-pro, inconspicuous
They can’t get rid of this uh, no one be spitting this shit on some bigger shit
Mack called them in it uh for rappers there ain’t no peace
I’m going have the game locked down like the police
They be ducking like whenever I’m arriving
Woo woo everybody 'bout to hear my sirens
Come on I be the best, I'm lyrically blessed, put y'all to the test
Got these rappers under arrest
C'mon, when I be spitting all my people bout to stand up
Hip-hop police got the game in the handcuffs
Yeah, ayo, I rock the girls and boys
Western Michigan y'all better make some fucking noise

[[D]]

Mack getting busy, fuck the gun play
Yo we relaxing like we chilling on a Sunday

I said it's Sunday but you know that we not going to church
We getting fucked up, no one as fly as us

I said I'm breakin' it down, when I be on it you know that I'm better
Yeah, she got the blue PJs, she matched it with the blue sweater
Yeah, you know I'm ready to flip, turn it up 'till I clip
She showed me the PJs and said "Don't you love the drip?"
Yeah, she ain't even really mean to be matching
Every time I'm spitting I'ma do it with passion
Yeah, I can tell that she's totally shook
I'm done with the verse, I'm 'bout to bring you back to the hook
I said I'm drinking on a Sunday and I'm high as fuck!
