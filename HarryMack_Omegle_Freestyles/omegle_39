[[A]]
Grab on the mic and I'm changin' the policy
All o' my stars align like astrology
Come off the tip o' this, it's domination
Stars be alignin' like a constellation
Ay, Mack, I go hard on the mic
Ay, make it dark, turn it to a starry night
Mack all up on it and I'm loose with the rhymes
Somethin' like the stars, I be ready to shine
Hold u', y'all know these rappers embarrassin'
Ay, what's your star sign? I'm Aquarius
Ay, y'all know my lyrics is wet
Whenever I'm rappin', I'm pressin' a threat
Yeah, all these other rappers are see-through
I said I'm Aquarius and she was like, "Me, too!"
Hold up, overhead I be bombin'
Peace to you 'cause we got that in common
Yeah, the star signs align, blow your mind with rhymes
I'm like Einstein's mind every time I create
Man, I kill it, no debate
'N all these other rappers, I'm about to make 'em wait
Yeah, I'm a god, that's what I said
Peace to the girl who be noddin' 'er head
Filmin' on her phone, I'm about to leave you scarred
I said I need three words, she said, "This is so hard!"
Yeah, y'all know I'ma last a whole year
I said, "Tell your friend to come over here!"
Yeah, 'cause Harry Mack is really 'bout to do this
I'ma rock a show so please mute your music
Yeah, now we together on the screen
Every time I'm rappin', I be livin' my dream
I'm doin' this for the real hip hop fiends
All the lyrics out my mouth sound too clean
Hold up, you know I'm usin' it soon
Birthin' a verse like it's out of a womb
Yeah, y'all know I'm droppin' the bomb
Ay, big love goes out to the moms
Ay, y'all know my lyrics, I send 'em
Peace to the wombs that's inside the women
Peace to the women that's birthin' the humans
Yeah, the thought of it is all-consumin'
I share love like a mother to they seed
I'm about to give the whole game what they need
Yeah, every time I rhyme, I drop true facts
I ain't got a womb, and I could never do that
I'm amazed by the women in my life
I'm amazed by the women in the world
Cuttin' through the track somethin' like a knife
Doin' this for all o' y'all girls
Hey, Mack, I know you remember this
Stand up for women, I live like a feminist
Y'all know I'm dentin' this track when I step to this
Every time that I rhyme, I be wreckin' this
Hold up, y'all know I get loose on the beat, bring all the heat
Harry Mack, I never been discreet, hard as concrete
When I rock the mic, it's complete
Matter fact, I stand tall all up on both feet
H-yeah, y'all know I'm spittin' the sound
Both o' my feet, they be grippin' the ground
They didn't know but they gettin' it now
Yo, your whole brain I be flippin' it now
H-Mack, I get loose with the flows
Grip with the feet usin' all ten toes
Yeah, when I grab the mic, man, I don't fail
Ay, y'all know I got nasty toenails
What can I say, prob'ly need to get a pedicure
Ay, every time I'm on the mic, my head is cured
Ay, do what I feel for the medicine
Step to the podium, I'm preachin' like the reverend
Yeah, y'all know I'm droppin' the anvil
On rappers' toes while they rockin' some sandals
I got 'em big, man, I got 'em all bleedin'
I'm killin' the game and you knowin' the reason
Hold up, I flow off the head
To your friend: ain't you glad that you came off the bed?
Yeah, y'all know I'ma rock both people
Got you both smilin' when live on Omegle
Ay, onto my lyrics they cling
Y'all know I'm shinin' like bling
Peace to my two new friends on Omegle
For watchin' me doin' my thing

[[B]]
Yeah, I be on some boss shit
Rappers, they can't even fly, they some ostrich
Ay, I come right up off the tip when I rip
Ay, microphone, I grip, I'm about to make you flip
They ain't fly, they like ostriches and penguins
I'm up in these rappers' faces, man, I got 'em flinchin'
Doin' what I feel, y'all know that I'm better
I'm hella expensive like some ostrich leather
Mack all up on it, comin' through with the lyrics the people dig
Somethin' like a ostrich egg, damn, my flow is big
Ay, Mack, I be massive, never been passive
Way above average, yes, I'm a savage, high off the cabbage
Lyrically smokin' mics, we're provokin', gettin' you open
I'm twice as dope as all competitors
Ay, I said, "That was cool, but I need better words!"
Hit me with somethin' more challenging and cleverer
Ay, Mack, I'm up on it, they be sayin', "Damn, he's dope!"
Ay, I do it from the melon, cantaloupe
H-Mack, man, y'all know they can't compute
My lyrics loot, I'ma chop a rapper like some fruit
That I'm eatin' from the produce section in the grocery store
Tell me, you ain't never heard nobody flow this raw
Mack comin' off the tip, I'm the new dude
He was like, "Bro, you got a plaque from YouTube! Who are you?"
I was like, "Well, let me send some bars through!"
I be representin' live for the hard crew
Yeah, they say, "Harry Mack, we hearin' ya!"
Compared to all these other rappers, I be so superior
Unh, and I'ma spit it 'til I'm out o' breath
I'm like Lake Superior except I got the depth
He be like, "No... No..."
Every time I rhyme, yo, my flow's dope
These rappers, they be stagnant, so they don't grow
And every time I'm spittin', man, you overdose
They never really comin' close
And y'all know I be spittin' from May to June
To July, I'm the new guy
Up in the room, make speakers go boom
Instrumentals 'bout to get consumed
On the tapestry behind you, it's the cycles o' the moon
Mack all up in it, I be callin' what I'm seein'
I got the people buggin' out, like, every time I'm freein'
Hold up, I been rockin' many places
I was like, "Come up on the cam, I'm inspired by your faces!"
Harry Mack, I chase this
Y'all know they get mad at Harry
I was like, "I need your illest vocabulary!"
They be buggin' For me, it's really nothin'
I'm rappin' with flows I saw you scratchin' your nose
Sometimes I get a itch there as well I'ma grab the mic, excel
Y'all know that we 'bout to dwell
Harry Mack, I get you high as hell
Every time I come off the tip o' the brain
Every time I rhyme, I flip it insane
They be like, "What the fuck's goin' on?"
Every time I'm rappin', I'm goin' strong
Lookin' at each other 'cause they can't believe it
Grab on the mic, tear rappers to pieces
Sweet Jesus, he's way too holy
When it come to rhymes, can't nobody control me
Yeah, I be spittin' with a passion
When I do it double time, they be laughin'
Yeah, she got 'er fist up to her mouth
'Cause they know can't nobody really fuck with it now
H-Mack, man, my head is way up in the clouds
So, there you go, the rap innovation
The YouTube plaque required a demonstration
Yeah, I'm comin' off the top kickin' new stuff
Basically, these flows is how I get my views up

[[C]]
Every time I rhyme, I be so evolved
Over tracks, I be stretchin' like a yoga ball
Ay, I got more talents that I'm showin' y'all
Ay, when I rock a show, they packin' wall-to-wall
Ay, I was just waitin' for the drums to drop
Any time I'm spittin', I'ma break you off with somethin' hot
Yeah, I got your whole vibe improvin'
Soon as the beat drops, I see your body movin'
Hold u', we 'bout to dance 'til the spirit is enhanced
Ay, I'm takin' risks, I'ma take a chance
Yeah, I'm blendin' with my fans, I'ma flex, no doubt
With no yoga ball, my mental is stretchin' out
Hold up, I kick the bars to make you listen
My brain, it's like it's doin' yoga, in some new positions
Yeah, 'cause I push it past the comfort zone
I get loose when I'm rockin' on this microphone
Ayo, I'm doin' me forever and y'all know I be the dopest
Ay, switchin' my position, now I'm in the lotus
I'm keepin' my focus, y'all know I'ma throw this on down
I got, like, everybody diggin' my sound, they all surround
H-Mack, off the tip, I'm never fake
Ay, fresh up out the oven, my lyrics is like a cake
Yeah, 'cause they soundin' sweet and they flavorful like frosting
CEO of freestyle flows, you know I do them boss things
Yeah, Mack all up on it, check the way I'm rockin' it
I love a ice cream cake and I love chocolate
Check the way I bust, I be givin' y'all enough
Word to pies 'cause I'm about to stomp through the crust
O' the Earth, yo, I give birth, my lyrics dispersed through many channels
'Cause they get dismantled, heavy like a anvil
Got your head noddin', I'm doin' this shit often
I'm droppin' rappers in they coffins, dawg, it ain't no problem
I'ma do me
Every time that I'm spittin', I'm killin' it truly
Mack, I be good for your health, I'm just like a smoothie
Automatic with lyrics, I'm just like a Uzi
When I be poppin' out, they all be yellin' out, "Who's he?"
I get groovy like Austin Powers
Yeah, I'ma be a rappin' boss for hours
Unh, y'all know my lyrics never mild
'Cause I been killin' mics since I was a child
And that's the third word that you provided
There ain't another rapper who could do it like this
I had dreams o' doin' it big
When I was just a little child, just a tiny-ass kid
I remember I had visions o' me up here rockin' words
Back when I was just a 4-year-old toddler
Yeah, ayo, I knew that I could spit it
I told my mom about it, she said, "Boy, go get it!"
But she said, "Listen, there ain't no way to act this...
...If you wanna do this rap shit, you gotta put in practice!"
I took that serious, I practice on the daily
Ever since I was a little kid, I been goin' crazy
Yeah, and now I'm havin' dreams o' havin' children o' my own
See, that's the cycle o' life, I'm expandin' my whole zone
I birthed the verse, my brain is the womb
And I keep growin' that verse 'til I'm in my tomb
My music, it'll last, even after I'm gone
So when I'm in the ground, my music'll carry on
It's my legacy, just like the child that I grow to do better
Ayo, the way I flip the words is truly too clever
H-Mack, man, you know I'm 'bout to wreck the nation
I'm droppin' facts for my children, plenty education
And y'all know I'm 'bout to lead 'em in a new way
And teach my child all four countries in the UK
H-yeah, and they love the way that I be locked in
She said, "Guess where I'm at!" I shoulda said Scotland!
I said, "England," then said, "I'm a dumb American!"
So thanks for the geography lesson, that shit's embarrassin'
Hold up, especially 'cause Scotland is my heritage
Yeah, gotta do better, yes, I am aware o' this
But all that I can do is try to grow every day
One foot in front o' the other, that's all that I can say
Gettin' better every time, me and other people combine
You teachin' me 'bout things I couldn't find in my mind
And y'all know that I'm comin' off the top just to work the flow
I shine like the lights in your background that's vertical
Ay, people know my bars are tight
You got the ivy growin' right over the starry night
I'm diggin' the vibe, believe me, I make this shit look easy
So sick with lyrics, I could prolly make you queasy
God damn, Mack is the man
Off o' the top, I kick raps with no plan
Way too much steez and I got what you need
And I wanna say thank you for rockin' with me
Like that!
