MC they feeling tarot cards and playin’ fables
And even if I stutter or stammer Im one bad mamma jamma 
Lambda lambda lambda MC they get they ass kicked
They look juelz santana in a jeweled bandana in a new Grand Canyon.
Make ya backflip 
You can get your lil ass kicked

I'm only geneous to those close enough to trust
The more more I face the madness I start making plans for raising havoc
Keep in mind me being kind ain't something you can take for granted
Your downgrading all my traits but your hatred is a wasted
