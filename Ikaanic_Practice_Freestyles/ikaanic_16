though sorry i'm just rhyming without no
ammo so i'm trying to be camouflaged no

lyrics are hard then they make your ship

ain't heard of sheep this is iconic it's

but not me bad i mean flip it cause he
is glad i'm trying to save it he's
wearing that addy dash
that's the blue shirt yeah i'm used to
never getting hurt cause my ego's not
hurting me
so i'm gonna work fervently and maybe
turn a couple leaves and maybe i can see
what's on the other side
shadow red hot chili peppers the other
side and most of these rappers are blind
so i'll pepper
the other side can i even rhyme other
side i don't know i'll let it slide i'm
sick with this [ __ ] like pesticides
put these pesticides i'm focused on my
mind what i want to achieve
but these people talking over me while i
spit on the beat and that's rude
but i don't care cause i'm keeping it
crude so you know how i do and listen to
how i breathe
i meditate to get my energy getting you
drunk like hennessy
plenty freeze and i'ma do them every day
with ease and i ain't saying that i
never had it bad but i clearly can't
afford that top for maddie that's cause

pound cake beat we'll just close it off
with that one and i'm gonna speak
every time you know that i need to order

freedom
or three simple words that you can rhyme
scheme
with i'm into her i'm into her what you
think
about the topic i don't know i be top
pick when i flow when you're gonna not
hit all the flows if you're thinking
right about it
so if you'll give me one or if you'll
give me three i'mma go and be gone to be
spit in the clean and then they just go
on go on to the next word or just go on
in my mind and then fly through the sky
that i find
inside of my mind cause i'm feeling all
the holes that i see it now cause i know
i do expose
all the way i never thought that i could
be flown all up in the skies that i'm
getting on the song

buy mom
kinda like my name was osama sorry
that where the mind went so you know
that i just need to find it

inside the mama then i'm gonna find all
the little lions alabama in
from boston to alabama i'm lost in the
lost in the tragic stanzas

the water that i'm gonna spit all of the
fluids hold up

avoid that right now i could talk about
that that topic for like hours but
freestyling about that is a little more
tough so
we'll get it though we'll get it though
when i feel more
in control of the soul that they pour
but i know that they go through a lot in
their soul when they got to depose all
the people who think that they don't got
the soul
to live like they do so they in the room
they in the
hate that they feel so crazy
yo i got the whole track to this beat
and i know i'm gonna
[Music]
facts that i speak every time that i
give you some hard ass words and you

people in the room so i go and spit the
blue little sky lyrics that you're gonna
fight through i'll give it to you now ah

what i'm gonna think about the lines in
my mind and the shower now
with the flows and the liquid going to
power now and all the flows i'm gonna go
devour now
okay you know that i'm gonna spit the
stations every time and i'm obligated to
be giving you the fire so
you know that i'm gonna birth and shake
all the verses wait it'd be like earth
and quake i beat
over flooding your cities with all the
flows and i'm gonna go up of the things
i'm gonna throw
inside of your mind and you feel it
really slow and i'm gonna be winning in
the room that i go to
cause i'm gonna run in and i know i'm
gonna refuse to be losing then you're
gonna think that i
fuse confused with the way that i'm
gonna through all the lyricists i'm
intruding the room
of the people they do refuse to tell me
that the seal of the liquid proof
inside they mind i'm gonna reveal the
truth that they don't got lines off top
and i do
this every day and i know that i say and
you know that you sway with the way i
maintain on the flows that i say and the
cadences they what you thought that
you'd never hear off of the brain cause
cause you know i spit the coldest
slaters flow type you know that i be
refrigerator
alligator like you gonna be saying me
see ya
what you doing i but don't see ya cause
you're gonna [ __ ] up with the flow and
then you thought you're gonna flow
without the word that he just going in
the throat
that you gonna say and i don't know hey
but i'm gonna say i'll be just flowing
off the brain
and i'm gonna tell you that i'm on my
mission and i'm never gonna hit the arm
mission
flows but i know that i'm omnipotent
with my omni vision i've been the dopest
and can be potent with flows he throws
out the mind and i know that i don't
need
rehearsing the flow because i cursively
flow
with the words that i know
[Music]
money trees should we do muddy trees
[Music]
reverse the beat though
oh my god say you said lick your lips
across yourself
okay you know that i've been just
spitting and i know that i'm gonna spit
all the way to
egyptians and they won't tell me that
i'm honest like all the pyramids type
flow that i be spitting yes you know
i've been the spirit
they're gonna be building in it in it
how crazy i flow the proud lazy real
flows that i
give into soul that i'm given to you
know you know
i am pharaoh taking over all the way
they'd be going through the
going through the control that they got
over people i feel like
pharaohs were kinda evil people if they
made slaves just build the pyramids
without food or water that they need but
i don't know
i wasn't there so i'm not gonna tell you
that i'm gonna be aware
of all other things i'm thinking it just
aware ah
okay you know that you need to stick to
spitting and your lips be crusty yes so
you'll be lick your living
and not be just sticking to your vision
cause you're listening to me you're
gonna be with your vision
with the vision that i'm speaking it's
the clearest vision
gonna be coming to the room you know
i've been division
with the flows i'm in a different
division d1 with the way i'm gonna spit
my mission
fifa's gonna be the thing i'm topically
spitting
oh now yes i'm gonna got all the
writtens
flow now every time i got to just living
flow style that i need to hot know the
spit and [ __ ]
see i need to just be focused on the
scene instead of waiting for the words
and then flowing no so clean so
i need to go and see how i'm gonna take
the words and spell and then tell you
that i'm waking up and wishing like a
well
that i could be better with the way i'm
gonna track
up with the way and you know i got
detract
traction with the way a fraction need to
give you
all the things that action never lacking
i've been there
been the dopest with the way i
tactically phrased i just know that i
all the packages they don't be listen to
me do
this it's exclusive royal with the flow
and you're gonna see me do
this every time you know that i spit the
truest
lines in my mind and i'm gonna do this
every time and i know that i'm gonna
feel resistance
but i know that i'm persistent with
flows insisting that i do
