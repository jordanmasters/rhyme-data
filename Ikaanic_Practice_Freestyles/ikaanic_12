[ __ ] know on the mosque he means they
don't know
in the other language do you know what
to do
you know that i be telling you i'm going
through the move but let me show
a little else then i don't really want
to get inside the turkish language but
let me tell you how right up in the
rhyme
cause i don't got the filler lines all
up in the vibe but turkish has the
ending lines in every line
so you can rhyme every word but
[Music]
there's like a there's like a little
thing in turkey where you if you add a
certain sound
yapomaski on the maz key give them as
key
do you have thee do you stand these
little things i say yes i'm gonna tell
you
that i sway to the other language that i
know flowing through the groove
but i'm not gonna try now let me tell
you
that i got time there is no delay uh
[ __ ] i [ __ ] that up at the end
but what's good people zero nation rocco
paula
you should write nah bro i'm just gonna
never write and see where that takes me
that's actually my goal at this point
i'm just going to never write and see
where that takes me on the track boy
i shouldn't ever say never because
there's going to be a timer like oh let
me let me write
but right now
i'm just gonna never write and see where
that takes me
cause you know i undercover lines and
they think
they think that i can't be doing this
couple years from now you don't think
that i'd be making hits i'd be doing it
now cause i find time sounds gonna
define
how khan's gonna right now sound
so how do you know that you're not doing
that you not knowing what we up through
so i tell you do you
do you know that imma go with fluid
little druid
spells i'm casting yes i'm telling you
i'm into doing
all the things you never do and so i'm
gonna improve it
it's the best the speed that i could
take it do you hear it cause you know
when you writing you not working on your
voice and clothes so the choice i know
is to be spit
in it in the hole togetherness i
practice it so never lacking with
the words of [ __ ] rhymes the flow
will say it's chicken thighs see
see i need to work on the lie the
different [ __ ] like the breathing i
i and the clever little licks that i
might try
so you know i'm ever with the clever
thing i'm thinking when i'm never
writing don't need to be blinking on the
line cause you know you're over thinking
with the line you'll be taking one two
three maybe full time the time you need
when you flowing on the mark so
let me try let me see where it takes me
so fly ah
yup yup what's good access gonna deny
the
all good mood cause you know vex cave
damn i need to step back if you know
that i be telling you the story and i
only need to throw all the territory
that i'm zoning into you gonna hold
yes i'm riding in my bike path yes i
might strike
at all the people who might grab all the
hate they gonna not read
[Music]
my time and when the free styling is so
perfect my timing with the riding is not
gonna be earning
cause i can't be flowing when i'm
writing so
let me tell you that i don't even to
like to go
in the pen and then just take the time
to not know
how you gonna say it and then you'll be
on the road
on the beat you'll be practicing your
lies memorizing all the things you need
to say
right in time but when i'm in the flow
it feels looked through my mind and i
know i'm going to tell you that the
feels going to shine when i
i never stutter or anything i just have
it naturally my parents have a good
rhythm too
rhyming is what i struggle with well the
rhymes are
that's i i struggled to rhyme too if
when i first started freestyling i was
only flowing with no rhymes
i was like my main [ __ ] i want to do
some i want a different vibe
different vibe right now crack a bottle
oh should i do this
ah okay
yeah i put ultra low latency so if you
want to throw words
if you guys want just want to toss words
i should be able to get them pretty
quickly or at least i could try i might
get into a zone or a story so forgive me
crack a bottle make your body hollow
with the flows i fill up yes you're
gonna need to swallow
on the pill that you be thinking he gon
gonna wallow yes i'm gonna stand tall
all the follow
all other followers gonna show me that
they gonna tell me that i'm the only
guy they gonna tune in to hold these
words i'm saying up on the mic they be
telling me bro you need to go
like 30 minutes earlier so we can see
you flow so so you know i needed to be
doing
this [ __ ] couple hours more you know i

the people that be programming the hate

i just take
take you into a for loop and then put
you in your mind so you can earn the
[ __ ] letters

effort oh the all you gonna die

pressure or the ones that they tell you
cause you know they gonna tell you that
you love
what you love and i know that you done
what you done through your soul even
though
these people put the pressure on you
cause they'll be the only ones that be
going for you if things get tough but
you know that zoning into
the things that are rough through the
beat you know i'm going into
things i'm gonna do they open doors for
you or not

do do you know how valuable that is
inside the life that we live in do you
know but some families don't really go
that road
