that i'm missing here mama was a hustler
pop you not so papa not so much
all right well if you look suspicious
they called you bluff powder puffs
couldn't make it in a concrete jungle if
you found stumbling then they pull up
right around your bumper and make you
run it home for no reason like force
stop and get the gun involved
they make you run it all pulled around
your bumper they make you run it
like come on so many different meanings
right here pull up right around your
bumper and make you run it
all for no reason right because the run
it pull up around your bumper
run it you need to run your bumper like
run your car but also
run it for no reason like forrest gump
come on stop and get the gun involved if
you get to thinking yourself i swear
it's protocol they feeding for reasons
to bust and they don't know no
laws
laws come on bro the the multi it's all
connected toby's crazy your thinking
yourself i swear it's protocol they
feeding for reasons to bust and they
don't know no
laws other than keeping it tucked in
they draw so they bridges cause the
discs can always find you if you
slipping or you tripping without a map
let me guide you down the road unless
travel don't let them
they keep you tripping down the road
less traveled let me get a
map let me lead you through the gravel
through the rocky road
yo come on everything is like everything
flows so
seamlessly to the next to the next the
disc can always find you if you're
slipping or you tripping without a map
let me guide you down the road let's
travel don't let the gravel define you
cause there's plenty folk that made it
down the path they have been assigned to
at birth
don't let the gravel decide define you
don't let the road
that they put you on to find you find
out find where you're going
and get to new roads the the road isn't
just
the place where you start it's where it
leads where you
end come on talking preach and
determined by your girth no matter how
big what'd he say
it ain't determined by your girth down
the path they have been assigned to at
birth
worth in the earth and determined by
your girth no matter how big you get we
all go
end up in dirt rehearse all that hurt
and you'll end up with a purse
this dog's a real [ __ ] but your value in
earth is determined by your girth is
kind of funny kind of size don't matter
type vibes
no matter how big you get we all end up
in dirt rehearse all that hurt and
you'll end up with a first
of digits that only make you live it
when they're dispersed into your
cellular device try to play it wise that
is a hell of a disguise that you went
across your eyes like abandoned
candies pictures only show that you've
been standing slanted and someone's
candid pictures only show that you've
been standing
slanted
come on people pose for those candid
pictures just lies
just lies and then what you're showing
through your eyes
start being you
instead of being what you think you need
to be
and what they defined you to be go
through your own road see how it's all
connecting
across your eyes like abandoned and then
it all started from saying mama was a
hustler papa wasn't like about him and
who he is and how he
what his road was candice pictures only
show that you've been standing slanted
in someone's vision that leaves you
stranded and with nothing to show for
all the demanding
bandwidth used in hopes you get approved
by a dude who's confused on exactly what
to do with your loyalty loyalty
can often cost you buoyancy you're only
doing this for some dude
to give a [ __ ] about you your your
royalty your loyalty is to these people
that these things that don't matter i'm
pausing everything but like come on
exactly what to do with your royalty
loyalty can often cost you buoyancy
when it's connected the folk that's
drowning choose love that constantly
keeps you grounded
and those are in the circus if you ain't
clowning
[Music]
don't join the focus circus if you ain't
clowning
because if you ain't clowning
[Music]
their vibes go together so well is he
wearing what shirts are they wearing are
they wearing each other on their
garments
because whatever they're wearing is fire
too it's like a
the robe type i don't even know that
looks so fire big creek coming through
with the originality coming
diamond and bills are rolling faces and
pink it rains and falling and singing
garage your building could dry
living for materials ain't really living
your life there's a fine line between
give and take you do what you love don't
let them make you love what you hate
i've been where you been collecting
don't make them love what you hate bro
who can relate to that
who can relate to that you you think you
like some [ __ ] that you don't even
really [ __ ] with but only
only you're pretending to be fronting
like you [ __ ] with it because
you think you should because whoever you
respect or whoever views you're letting
in is telling you to look at how you
can't see the goal that's within hold up
[Music]
too busy looking out you can't see the
glow that's within you gotta
gotta take a breath gotta know be in the
moment don't let those outside voices
the whole song is so fire god damn
[Music]
the whistle of simplicities that echo
off the trees
think about the time you just sat there
in a breeze
and when life would sit down and listen
to the breeze the whistle of simplicity
is an echo off the trees
not the ones you choke but the one that
helped you breathe
that gave you not the one that choked
make you choke not the weed
the ones that help you breathe come on
bro
this shit's so crazy not the ones you
choke but the one that helped you
breathe
inhale exhale that slow that gives you
hope that one day you escape and have to
save your folk like there's much more to
life
than struggling and hustling backwards
reverse all that nonsense become a road
master because they say so don't mean
that you have to they speeding
through life don't mean you go faster
pump your brakes tell your people you
love them
no time to waste giving roses in public

type of vibe i'm getting from this beat
so so sick
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the kingdom's on fire the blood of a
young messiah i see sinners in a church
i see sinners in a church
sometimes
the blood of a young messiah the sin is
in the church sin is in the church
the kingdom's on fire the blood of a
young messiah i see sinners in a church
i see sinners in a church
sometimes i might be introvert there's a
war inside
i hear battle cries sometimes i mean
might be introvert there's a war
inside being sons playing with guns the
devil's a liar fulfill your wildest
desires
now i don't want to be the one to doctor
this but if you can't feel pain name you
can't feel the opposite
the fight between the gang and fight
you'll never win the fight
between the yin and yang's a fight
you'll never win bro
if you feel pain if you can't feel pain
then you can't feel the opposite you you
need everything
you need the whole spectrum i study
humans that makes me an anthropologist
but i know it's dark times parts that
means i'm an anthropologist
i'm not into politics
yo i [ __ ] with lil sims crazy right now
unless that makes me an anthropologist
i'm not into politics but i know it's
dark times
parts of the world still living in
apartheid but if i don't take this
winter's flight that's career suicide
though i should have been a friend when
your grandma died i see the illness in
my arm laying in her bed i see a soul
rising as a body gets closer to death
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah we we shifted from the beach side
uh
thinking deep to like some some pre
war like this beat is so epic bro
this is so epic this is a score this is
a movie score
[Music]
the feelings i keep aside but it's time
to reveal
i hate the thought of just being a
burden i hate that these conversations
are surfaced
sims are artists or simply the person to
you i'm smiling but really i'm hurting
i dedicate my life and gave my heart
over 20 something years left wondering
how i even feel but was it even worth it
i bought a lot of pillars spill it in
verses one day i'm wearing this next day
i'm a worse
can we talk about the dancing right now
can we talk about the dance how clean
that is the control of this man
over 20 something years left right here
to the emotion of the movement
how i even feel but was it even worth it
i bought a lot of pillars spill it in
verses
one day i'm worthless next day i'm a
worse myth close to success back to
happiness i'm the furthest
at night i wonder if my tissues right on
their own
hoping i will fulfill ain't his purpose
angel's way he glided
on that and what she's saying too
shout out to the chat i see everything
going on we're gonna get to it after
this song shout out everyone
on their own hoping i will fulfill amy's
purpose
angel said don't let ego be a
disturbance in the demon
angel said don't let your what'd he say
and the demon said you [ __ ] you
earned this
angel said don't let your ego angel said
don't let ego be your disturbance
don't let ego be your disturbance
realize there is a prison condition
just like how he she said you can't feel
the op
if you feel pain if you can't feel pain
you can't feel the opposite
now she's talking about how the angel
said don't let your ego
be a disturbance but the devil said
[ __ ] you earned this you need both
you need both to stay grounded in the
middle come on everything you're
deserving
realize there is a prison and that's be
a condition that's far
man it's like they can't sleep till our
spirit is crossed how much fighting must
we do we've been fearless enough
all we've seen is broken homes from
poverty corrupt government official lies
and atrocities how they talking almost
threatening the economy
knocking down communities to re-up on
properties i'm directly affected it does
more than just bother me
knocking down communities to re-up on
their properties it affects
[Music]
look beneath the surface don't just see
what you want to see she's
preaching bro this is like this is like
listen to this in like class
like come over me look beyond the
surface don't you see what you want to
see my speech ain't involuntary
projecting attention straight from my
lungs
i'm a black woman and i'm a proud one
[Music]
[Applause]
look at this look at this from here it's
in the same scene
but it looks historic right look at that
is it historic literally not sure
i'm guessing it's the same video but god
damn that's fire
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
this choreography is nasty
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
we're not alone
[Music]
trevor
[Music]
she's switching see see how just the
vibes of the
of the instrumental switch i feel like
he's i feel like she's getting into like
some hope
i feel like she's getting into hope now
like just the vibe of the music just
[Music]
changed
[Music]
more happy imagery
[Music]
your introversion led you here intuition
protected you along the way
feelings allowed you to be well balanced
and perspective gave you foresight
the top of the mountain is nothing
without the climb
[Music]
the top of the mountain is nothing
without the climb
if you get dropped off at the top of the
mountain what you doing what are you
doing if you get dropped off at the top
of the mountain
you're not going down that ain't you
only the people who got all the way up
there is going to know how to get back
down
[Music]
that's fire
process over results all day
[Music]
alone but not lonely your truth unveils
as you embark on a journey of what it
takes
to be a woman
okay okay little sims
wow wow
all right now we're back in the chat now
we're back in the chat yo that was
epic bro twinkling shouts out to you
for putting me on and putting all of us
on to that that was
absolutely beautiful that was beautiful
wow okay um god
god damn that singer coming through had
to drop by showing some love i
appreciate you homie hey you could get a
you could get a request too let me know
let me know
um with that tenor right there uh
damn god damn that was crazy i was fully
immersed in that i don't know what's
what's going on in the chat jakes112 is
chilling michael chillin
uh that singer says this song kind of
just sat with my soul
jesus that is um
yeah that's that's the appropriate
reaction um xenix what's good homie
um manny shouts out jordan
shouts out uh who's [ __ ] with that
though who who was feeling that that was
crazy uh that was amazing
um yes sir t burns that was pretty crazy
100
uh twinkling the other two i requested
aren't beautiful a
i'm sure i'm sure they have something
beautiful about them everything has
something beautiful about them
michael says that i feel you man i i had
a thought loop for a moment and tear
ducts started to fill up
yo that's crazy the making something
making you think of something that makes
you tear up is
is um i feel that i feel that heavy
um it's not the actual thing it's just
with the memory or the thought that it
sparked up that's that's happened to me
definitely
um but anyway
anyway let's do it let's do it let's do
it baby
um we moving on yo everyone in the chat
just letting you know if you
if you send your request like 18 times
that's
more likely that i won't do it just
letting everyone know
uh and keeping it extremely real also
shouts out to my man uh john v
really appreciate the the support homie
i have done easy mo freeze though that
is actually
also on my uh channel as a separate
video um so you can you can go check
that out
um definitely let me know if
you want to
want to switch that but we got more we
got more
and shouts out to whoever it was that
sent
friends remix i did get your um
paypal my man so we're gonna get to
yours it came through
uh the next one is george the poet pink
matter
by the homie twinkling yet again we got
another we got two twinkling
specials in a row right now um
let's do it yeah friends remix i got you
nikita i got you
uh also let me do this make sure to pin
the comment for any new people coming
through how we feeling though how we
feeling in general
uh what y'all up to how's your week
started out um i'm always super pumped
on mondays
because the the whole stream schedule is
starting it's starting anew
and um i'm super pumped with that below
aziz what's good man
uh let's get it
to skip q baby right i just had to get
the logistical message in there
ignore that guys um unless it applies to
you
let's get to george the poet's pink
matter
also um this whole that whole little
sims introvert
it was all about or not all about
because i feel like it was about a lot
of different things
but she ended it with that's what it's
like to be a woman so i feel like this
is
that everything that she was talking
about was in the perspective of being a
woman i
i wasn't really sure if it was about you
know being black
um in society or whatever it else
whatever else it could have been but
that's that's very interesting i feel
like that
i mean that whole song and video needs
another listen to anyway to really get
get what's up because the first time
you're just kind of immersed
and listening obviously seeing what
she's saying and stuff but i feel like
on another listen now you can
you can have that filter over it the
last lines filter over it while watching
it too
and i feel like it'll add more meaning
so definitely recommend uh y'all do that
um to someone say mo hey what's good mo
beats
uh been a minute since i've seen you bro
um shouts out let's get it
[Music]
all right george of the poet is fire and
this is live
i love the live vibes already um spoken
word is another one of my
uh you know i really [ __ ] with spoken
word
um so
i really felt good george the poet and
he raps too it's it's musical combined
with spoken word which is just
rap and like for all intents of purposes
intents and purposes um is it intensive
purposes or
i think it's intense and purposes right
but i when i was little and not i think
i know it's intense and purposes
but when i was little i always thought
it was intensive purposes
for all intensive purposes that kind of
makes sense

right let's let's just let him talk lips
say

this kind of thing a lot of guys take
offense but
as you hold your breath you hope to
death that my free running fingers
proceed conor lingard
you listen to too much r b stunning
singers stunning fame
you can tell that i'm running game but
you like the way i'm running this game
once the fun and the pain that run in
the veins have begun in the brain they
become and became one in the same lesson
they become and became the one in the
same once the
yo the word the poetry of this is crazy
poetry this is crazy once the fun and
the pain that run in the veins have
begun in the brain they become and
became one and the same that's
just enough to help you forget some of
the shame but not enough to stop you
from coming again
see see see that physical attraction
i was given this frank obviously i
should have known it was going to be a
frank ocean cover
is it a cover or remix i think it's a
remix with his own
stuff it has to be because frank ocean
was just singing crooning on this
fire album frank ocean orange i had that
[ __ ] on repeat for a long ass time
um that fire album i don't know where
these things appear from
premature acceleration all of those the
gear so she enjoyed the ride but it
drove her close to tears i told this
girl know yourself
keep your lane discipline you know when
you can tell people ain't listening
brand new car key becomes scratchy cocky
hater never becomes patchy cocky
she becomes obsessed with car key and
cocky
like khaki crap peter never becomes
patchy khaki
she becomes obsessed with all that she
can't be so that's 15 love to patriarchy
see for men it's called coming because
you come to consensus
she resents the sound of his voice when
his sense is found because her defense
is down but she ain't under pretenses
the one given a hundred percent is the
one that resents this
[Music]
the one hold up that whole answers
and what he's saying hold up let's let's
hear what he's saying she resents the
sound of his voice when his sense is
found because her defense is down but
she ain't under pretenses
the one given 100 is the one she resents
the voice of his sound
when he presents this but she she know
the pretenses
it's fine because her defense is down
but she didn't understand
the one given 100 is the one that
resents this
the one giving her a hundred percent is
the one who resents this
the passing satisfaction and dents in
your bed
can't force it all to make sense in your
head i'm overloaded with lies when i
roll with the guys
you should thank me for pulling the wool
over your eyes that's the only reason i
got sheep on my farm
when we have a rolling hay i ain't
sweeping the bomb
i'm the one sawing sees but you're
reaping a harm and it's worse cause
you ignore your creeping alarm the last
thing you want to do is steep on a crown
but i write this keeping my calm would
you asleep on my arm cotton candy
my kind of majin buu you got an angry i
sidelined a margined you
you expect more for me pardon you
this this is a tough scene i feel like
bro
i feel like this is a tough scene right
now
it seems like the guy is doing [ __ ] that
the girl isn't down with
but he's trying to justify it
sideline the margin jew you expect more
from me
harder than you you would think all the
beats would harden you
now you're back to fronting like i'm the
right guy but i left you feeling like a
side chick you see it in the next you
read him like a psychic worried that i
run into a nicki minaj and it's bound to
end up in a sticky massage is it one
function
many a chemical and you get them at all
why do i do it why do you have it why
did this become an undeniable habit
why don't you go to ann summers and buy
the real packet instead of keeping me as
an unreliable rabbit
how can you expect me to return all the
favors you're genetically predisposed to
maternal behaviors
the way he the way he's painting the
the actual thought process of some
people because you're genetically
predisposed to maternal behaviors
we agreed to let it run its natural
course forgetting that nature is an
actual force
and when this force becomes
insurmountable to what extent can we be
held accountable
yeah off the gate you knew this was
gonna be some
off the gate you knew this was gonna be
some [ __ ] bro
with the first bar with the first bar
[Music]
because the first bar was saying what
was the first part he was saying like
hold up did your lips say don't but yeah
i say commence now right there
so your lips say don't but your eyes say
commence now the whole scene
it was all painted and then and then at
the end
it's natural forces how are we gonna be
held accountable
if it's what's already going to happen
to what extent can we be held
accountable
hold up and when this force becomes
insurmountable and when this force
becomes insurmountable to what extent
can we be held accountable that's some
so [ __ ] up
that people actually use to justify
their actions
they're [ __ ] up actions anyway um
that's some deep [ __ ] bro you were
saying that wasn't beautiful i mean
the depends on the definition of
beautiful
i wouldn't call that beautiful though
you're right
um but the picture he's painting the
message he's giving
with the words and the way he's aligning
the
the syllables and poetry i mean there's
definitely there's definitely beauty in
that

mr osus where can the queue be scene
um that's a that's a great
question i don't know i don't know if
there's a you can't see it now
to answer the question it's not
available to be seen i just
keep a track in my own head from my
phone and the super chats
um but if anyone knows of a way where i
could actually
keep like a queue and a list that people
can see it
i feel like things exist like
streamlaser i'll do my own research
i'll do my own research and figure it
out but i feel like that's actually
um especially the last couple weeks the
whole streams have been
super chat requests which i really [ __ ]
with and appreciate y'all it's it's not
a problem at all i just
i think that's a good idea to have the
queue accessible and viewable
um so all right let's get it toby in wig
weight wildlings is next though and
chance i see you coming through with
another one bigfoot we're gonna get to
soon um after my man dimitri

the green teeth though bro
the green teeth bring it back
flow sick hospital every time i bust a
riddle you should feel like getting down

ground
you know i'm straight about the leap
better watch how you speak real geez
don't chatter
i'm bitching at the club creak if you
lose with your teeth blast yours get
shattered
ouch but it don't matter if it hold the
same it's all no plateau updates that's
not made
oh man this game is otherworldly it
don't
[Music]
pest of pain ouch but it's involuntary
the rule of evil ain't necessarily
monetary
i'm blessed to carry the commentary
forward the root of evil
ain't necessarily monetary bro
it's not it's not it's it's the mind
it's the mind that gives the monetary
that value
because if it's not money it's whatever
else the
society or or uh people as a whole the
people around you place the value
in right because sometimes it is money
and people act shitty
based off the the money and the value
that it holds sometimes
people it's it's the way you look right
the the way you harm yourself because
you think you don't look
the way you need to and you do things
the way
that other people want you to be doing
so you're not you it's
um anything that's material basically
and it could be anything that's material
um that takes control of you of the
non-material in your head
um anyway again toby obviously we were
gonna get deep because it's toby
um but obviously he's going crazy it's
involuntary the rule that he will ain't
necessarily monetary i'm proud to tell
me i'm blessed to carry the commentary
forward to the masses that never won't
pass

editorials the show that we smashing the
fashion the boss and the choreo

manners
my favorite villain is the drop of
victor vaughan but every time i had a
great day intro
imma sing along victor vaughn that's
some i feel like we've listened to a
victor von song it's just mf doom one of
his because emma
he had a whole bunch of different
aliases and different names that he
dropped songs

he's referring to super villainy
the villain is the drop on victor vaughn

was scared to raise my arm like
this my dream this my life in a class of
my own
but i was afraid to raise my arm come on
my arm that
crazy that's a bar bro
in a class of my own but afraid to raise
my arm
in a class of my own but i was scared to
raise my arm like
this my dream it's my life i sacrifice
it all except my soul in a firm belief
there is a god
watching out when all the other used to
doubt felt my pain and pointed down and
said son your time is now
i think my grandma pulled some strings
on the low but that's between her and
the lord i never know
but though they caught me i think my
grandma pulled some strings on the low
but that's between her and the lord i'll
never know
put some strings on the low but that's
between her and the lord i never know
but though they caught me into spinning
complex magazines double exhale the vibe
and whatever in between
it's safe to say that dreams come true i
guess don't let nobody tell you
try for yourself just know that i was
once considered just a dreamer but i
paid my dues and turned so many dollars
to believers
they used to say they used to say
they used to say they used to say
they used to
[Music]
it's not for real they used to say
it's not for real come on
this is dreaming it's not for real
just caught that sample bro
is different bro
[Music]
let's go let's go let's go let's go baby
come on
come on chance don't miss like i said
like i said chants
do not miss um
all right all right let me say let's get
to the chat real quick bowser said great
lyrics inspiring yes sir yes sir
below says the only thing that annoys me
about american conscious
lyrical rappers is that so many lack the
energy and character to make their music
replayable
that's not on big crit he says big crit
is different um
100 uh i do i do agree with that
um in a sense i don't i don't
necessarily think it's american
i don't necessarily think that um but
the conscious lyrical rapper's part of
it
i think there's a lot of people who make
the mistake that if you have
bars that
you got potential or or if you have bars
that that'll get you to a certain place
um
i think bars are actually
third on the list um
of importance maybe lower depending i
feel like you need
voice voice is and i don't know how
you'll separate voice delivery and flow
because they very
they're very much interconnected um but
voice delivery and flow all above bars
all above bars swag and charisma
swag and charisma above bars bar
what you are actually saying in terms of
blowing up
in terms of catching eyes in terms of
getting respect in terms of getting
people to listen to you with the
replayability
um what you're actually saying
is much lower on the totem pole than
people realize
um and that's not me saying i don't
value bars and i don't value what you're
saying obviously that's not true
but in terms of what people want to
listen to
if they can't get what you're saying and
that's that's a
that's a huge reason why legends amazing
all-time rappers
like we were just talking about mf doom
might not have gotten to
the the notoriety in a global sense
in a mass appeal sense that uh
they might deserve based on their
lyrical abilities
right um and and he's a legend in the
game he's a legend he will he is a
legend regardless mf doom is what i'm
talking about
but that's a great example of one of
those
uh reasons right but he had the voice he
had the originality he had the swag he
had the delivery he had all of that so
i'm not like
i'm not putting down i'm of doom in any
way i'm just saying in terms of a mass
appeal stance
i feel like he was always people always
say emma dooms one the most underrated
and whenever you hear see or hear
someone being underrated
which generally means they don't get the
mass appeal
generally means that people the
replayability
for more more people is lower um
but if you're into the poetry the the
rap there is an audience there's a very
dedicated audience and you can get
far in those bar heavy lyrical conscious
type stuff
just by having the thought process
required to write it down
and think of those things and think of
the poetry it's just not as
big and broad of an audience um
you know as delivery and flow and
musicality
reaches um anyway that's what i'm saying
that's what i'm saying
uh yet mumble rap still thrives and
that's a whole that i mean that
what i'm saying is literally why mumble
rap can exist
because um it's it's the song it's the
production
it's it's what you're listening to it's
it's how the music
the rhythm makes you feel it's not about
what they're saying
and you know if you you
like calling it mumble rap is you know
you shouldn't even call it that it's not
really even rap it's a whole nother
genre that have
that has emerged through rap being
mainstream
this has now emerged it's a whole other
genre to me and call again mumble rap
it's not rap it's it's different you
know rap is about the words it's about
what you're saying it's about
that's you know that's what rap is about
um so
that's why i don't even really regard
mumble rap as rap
i would like a new new word for that uh
so let's figure one out
uh but anyway let's get it let's get it
let's get it baby
i got into some topics i love that i
love that below uh
getting deep into the the discussion is
some of my favorite [ __ ] i might
honestly just talk with y'all a little
bit

day and age i'll raise your grave
anything it takes to save the day
neural master technology and magic
use my rapping so you all can see the
hazards plus entertainment where many
are brainless
we cultivated the lost art of studying a
broader body
automate a heart a slayer fascinating
combination cyber warlords are
activating abominations
harmonation with hatred we ain't with
that we high-tech
archaeologists searching for
knick-knacks composing musical stim
packs that impacts the song
crack the mode of what you think you rap
before i used to be a mag soldier but
see there's to me
there there's a disconnect with the
vocals and the beat
to me on this song right now it's not
meshing together
the the way i mean maybe subjectively
the way i want it to but
there's there's there's there's a
disconnect it's an old-school voice vibe
the beat is nasty
but the either the mix or or the
combination there's something there's
something off to me
i didn't respect orders i had to step
forward tell them this ain't for us
living in a post-apocalyptic world
morbid and horrid the secrets of the
past they hoard it now we just boarded
on our futuristic spacecraft no mistakes
black it's our music we must take black
nothing to take away from the the lyrica
the poetry of it the
the dense rhyme schemes the the flows
what he's saying he's like painting a
picture but
[Music]
what the [ __ ]
[Music]
definitely some futuristic type
sounds being used right now
is my camera off god damn one second
what happened
down i'm feeling like a ghost in a shell
i wrote this
a jail playing host to a cell for the
pure verbal
they said my sentence was equivalent to
murder just another hurdle i bounced
through a portal
i knew they had the mind state of mere
mortals my ears morphed to
receptors that catch up every word about
gravity control and the families they
hold for handsome ransoms
on the run with a handgun blast by a
force i am warned that a planet wide man
with cannons will make me abandon my
foolish plan of uprising
[ __ ] die and i hijack a mech control it
with my magical chance so battle advance
through centuries of hip-hop
legacy mega speed hyper want the
automators crib and light the torch they
can't fight the force
victory is ours once we strike the
stores and surprising wise men looked at
the horizon
thinking more capitalism is the wisdom
in prison
all cities is empowered with rhythm
like he's telling the story i just can't
get over the fact that the beat and
voice
the it's just not going it's just
i'm keeping it fully real with y'all to
me
wisdom and like prison all citizens
empowered with rhythm
we keep the [ __ ] alive by talking with
idioms
[Music]
it's not the minor chord though it's not
the minor chords
[Music]
yeah marcellus exactly what marcellus
said
[Music]
is it eternal evil concern with thievery
medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we
ahead of that
lay it down with sound waves the pound
pavement original
minstrels my central processing unit is
it too with my heart for this art
not artificial cause that makes it hard
to miss you
all right so so i got i got i needed to
give more respect to the bars too and
what he's saying the the internal
programmer is not artificial hold up and
with sound waves the pound pavement
original minstrels my central processing
unit is into it my heart wasn't
not my cpu is in tune with my heart for
this art
not artificial with the intelligence
though cause that makes it hard to miss
you
copycats finish last in the human race
staying glued to safes to prove to take
a boot up right
we got copycats finished last in the
human race 100
i mean if you're a copycat you're
innately putting yourself behind someone
because someone needs to do it
for you to be able to copy but that
letter's blessed with fresh [ __ ]
undetected by yes my question for five
fleeting nanoseconds of faith protecting
the pride for conspiracies against my
cosmos
while i float the d.o tokyo with opio or
disgust combustible rust clusters with
plus
ebay cyber police and a computer crew
confused again
but i can make a kick around that secret
telepathic mind it takes this greatness
from the matrix
esperant professor rushes a cold
depression with correction measured
perhaps the world's a desert cannibal
the human brains for dessert
buried in a deep dirt mobility inert i
insert these clothes for the cataclysm
ever since i had a vision use my
magnetism
in this modern metropolis to try to lock
us up
under preposterous laws it's not for us
the modern metropolis trying to lock us
up in this
the laws that are just not for us like
the the rhyme schemes and
and the the denseness of the of the
rhymes and
the stories he's painting like what he's
doing with the on a pen
level is crazy this is a great way
a great um
well example for what we were talking
about earlier the pen is stupid on this
one
it's a whole [ __ ] story some
futuristic
like in the the dense rhyme schemes and
all that he's doing
but the sound the the mix isn't isn't
done to uh i don't know i don't even
know
the word like proper is the word for me
but maybe it's done exactly how they
wanted it to be it maybe wants they
wanted it to sound like this
um but yeah it's and 4.5 million views
obviously
like people [ __ ] with this heavy it's
just my subjective opinions
[Music]
30.
[Applause]
[Music]
i guess i'm gonna tell you that i'm
gonna
[Music]
he wet till it flows he held on your
dawns you held to the
door who's gonna rule metropolitan flows

core these basic things they saying you

honestly what is we doing it for
my happiness i'm still pursuing the
source lay my life over these lucrative
scores
my happiness i'm still pursuing the
source laid my life over these lucrative
chords for my happiness i'm still
pursuing a source
lay my life over these lucrative scores
document struggles that we choose to
endure

my energy i gotta protect where will i
go now this flow is so
it's so different too bro his flow
is stupid and it comes with the cadences
the multi schemes thoughts in my dreams
so often it seems prophetic all the
caution it brings

although vexed my energy i gotta protect
where will i go next back to the
conclusions that i made in the past much
prior to the current president early
state is a wrap

a different area codes but check it my
premature premonitions are part of my
existence
so every page that is written is pinned
with such conviction
listen to music it's obvious that the
substance missing a lot of tests comes
to dose to whom much is given and i

twitch link in the description come
through uh that's what we're doing a
full sesh baby
a full freestyle sesh uh that was a
little sneak peek
um but inion as i'm verbally abusing
uh that's a new one for me
that's going into my bag it's funny
because they're all in my bag
technically
but sometimes i say [ __ ] i'm like um let
me what what i actually mean by added to
my bag is put it in an omegle
because when i say when i when i'm live
it's more me
working out all the different wordplays
that i could be using in different
pockets and that's i mess up a lot
more um here because i let myself go
that extreme
um but when i'm on omegle and monkey i'm
trying to hone in
hone in the bars you know

noche marcellus chillin
um and everyone lurking in the
background student savior
uh and mats mckelson um yo iconic i have
a question for you as hm
expert i'm comparing one of hm's album
songs with this freestyle do you have
any tips for what songs
oh first of all appreciate the love
homie um
sending sending the super chat but
um i think i mean my favorite songs from
harry mack is they told me that's really
like
from the heart napoleon dino napoleon
hill sorry not
napoleon hill um amazing song
and then there's there's another song
that that's that's a standout for me
from the album [ __ ]
they told me in napoleon hill for sure
uh and if you want to see him like
flexing the double time now
next gear is nasty not my favorite
because the other two are my favorites
um but next gear is obviously nasty
um because he flexes everything that he
can be doing
um also talks is [ __ ] um when i say not
my favorite i literally mean not the top
two
not saying it's not good because i [ __ ]
with next year's probably the third one
on my list there
so yeah go go check out those three um
but you know
he's definitely had i think his
freestyles are on another level
um to me especially more recently
uh someone like if you asked me to give
you his top three freestyles there
they would be enter the top three in his
album uh they told me as a hip-hop
masterpiece to me like that's like
the classic 10 out of 10 record to me
they told me fire um goosebumps every
time i listened to it so
that's the definitely one if you're
gonna pick one that's the one i'd pick
um but yeah just listen to content just
listen to his whole album make it make
the choice for yourself bro
um that's what i'd say overall um but
yeah
yeah we out we out and brandon downey i
have done bulls on parade
peace
