afterthought flow i know that i'm gonna
[Music]
vigorously it's a little ambiguous if
you think that you're speaking with me
listen my g it's iconic for president

you will look back one day and just
reminisce on all the things you could
have done and now you're not just heaven
sin oh my god i should have said
what i wanted to say that's what i do
every day that makes these rappers look
slow with molasses i put they down on
their ass
what you grow [ __ ] slower than grass
does never gonna reach the sun
this battle be over before begun i
already won
no wonder they so stunned oh my oh me is
that an avocado
holy moly oh no it just got crushed must
be guacamole
i don't know though anymore the holy
geez i just drank holy water
and i wasn't on my knees it's like the
guys in the three kingdoms but it wasn't
the three wise man
must have been the three kings um i
don't know i can't understand i
just don't see resemblance i don't
recognize these men
who the hell are they though oh i see
where they go they're burnt now
looking like burnt toast how they're
frozen in the arctic coast it doesn't
make any sense
but when i play hockey in the arctic
coast i go coast to coast and then i
snipe pop cheddar right off the freaking
post
yeah true that's how i do oh my god i
thought there was more words there was
you know my boy junior b i'm like where
you from qc quebec
you're my pal d.r.e how about you he's
like you're my pal junior b
but what the hell let's pick up this
madame standing off the street man
looking fine as hell yeah she sure is
look at the skirt
when the french girl is looking cute you
know i like to flirt yeah it's true
it's true that's how i work but i don't
want to hog the mic so i finally started
making work
nah homie you got high five so you can't
really be hogging on the mic nah
cause i got the high five too so i grab
a hold and i tell you that i go through
but
let me look at the [ __ ] comments you
know i'm automatic with the pneumatic
pressure i got this and i don't know

any what are the women of hip-hop beats
like you guys know any if you want to
comment any
women of hip-hop beats that you [ __ ]
with so he can flow into hillyback
stream see
the first thing that came to my mind was
uh fuji's ready or not
oh let's do that yeah let's do that next
that i'm going busting yes i know i
trust in all the things i know so
adjusting is really easy when i put
into no mind believe me cause i'm gonna
defeat these little problems that i'm
seeing
and i know that i'm gonna click a couple
times and spit a couple lines at the
same time and you gon tell me that it's
easy
no cause i don't i think i know i got
the donuts think of the way i'm waking
up i'm gonna tell you that i blink
one or two times and i'm gonna go on my
[ __ ] rink yes i'm skating down the
driveway cause i got the things to do
yeah do what i do when i don't need a
break or any transmission right into it
dude
you know i like to bring the static man
i'm charismatic
i'm like automatic pneumatic what the
heck is that though and i'm so strategic
i got the tactics you know what's weird
though that silent p and pneumatic and
pneumonia
i mean i wouldn't have spelt it like
that as a spelling bee if i had to
i mean i guess i'm eliminated but it's
okay what is up with the pedo anyway
cause
even when you spell philippines it
doesn't sound like a p okay it's weird
to me
this english language who invented these
e's and a's and i o's and u's i don't
even know why
true but it's like dope kind of like
junior b when he smokes so when he types
he's looking just
taking over the show slipping into this
little disc while i'm crippling it
i don't need a little bit a lot of it
i'm slipping like banana peels just went
out the back of mario's cart when he's
doing laps around me
