bro in hip-hop
to with to where's like i'm here to lend
a hand i'm here to help
i'm here to help build i'm here to um
pass down culture
i'm here to pass down information so
being more like a vessel
like people like you like younger people
who are motivated inspired
so that's why i like i'm fully embraced
i respect that so much my man that's
that's crazy uh
tuning in like i said just that first
call was like oh [ __ ] king was watching
my video now you're literally on live
right now
um so i respect that and it comes
through really genuinely so
um also um where you were able to
put work in manifest um
this moment you know not to make my not
to make myself all uh special
no i got you i got you it's something
that you value and you were able to
bring it into your life um by hard work
and perseverance
and that's the that's the message i'm
trying to send a lot of the times when
i'm spitting too it's just like this
isn't just now this isn't just the past
couple months like
before that i've been like going to work
i do a lot of like nba [ __ ] like
basketball like the nba is
a big part of what i do and only the
past few months i've been going really
hard in the freestyle rapture but that
was also a passion when i was younger
so i'm just kind of combining everything
just hoops and rap is kind of
taking me um to where i need to be
do you actually play ball or no i don't
play ball more like
more like front office [ __ ] um like you
really know like the analytics
the finances players values and also
knowing like do you do sports reviews on
your channel
uh this channel i did before i did the
reaction stuff but i have a couple
podcasts
uh i do my i keep my own cap sheets for
like all 30 teams like
i'm trying to one day one day like this
hairy mac [ __ ] is raw but like
one day like get into the league like
ideally be a gm win championships like
that's like the route that i
want to take but that's like a 10 15 20
year type thing
um but who knows who knows you know just
kind of keeping both
moving man
um well you want to slightly
actually reviews and [ __ ] just
i've watched a lot of reviews like oh
yeah who else
who else have you you wanna who else
have you uh
watched i don't i don't know him by name
but i've
i watched watched a thousand reviews
that's crazy so you're going deep man
you're going deep
yeah i mean i want to um i respect it i
do too
i want to see how um
i just want to see how people interpret
the lyrics and
i feel like now people are starting to
appreciate it more
you know because i've been doing this
[ __ ] for a while so
um pretty much been at a high level for
a long time
and a lot of times people lose passion
and people lose
action so i think it's dope that i'm
still
able to deliver right now something that
people are finding and
here's the thing so let's say for
instance like you reviewed my la leaker
yeah
like three days ago somebody reviewed my
pound cake you know and i'm like
that was years ago you know and so
people are pulling up old gyms
digging in the crates and finding
vintage king lowe's freestyles and and
now
it's being reappreciated and it's being
spread through this internet that's
amazing so just watching the reviews
to kind of get an idea of myself because
you know
you don't don't really have
understanding of how you are received
until you hear people speak about you
you know so
why i'm just watching and hearing what
people say i'm i want i want to
know what bars they appreciate you know
so i'm like watching through the reviews
to see
who reacts on what and what part of your
consciousness is attached to what
i said you know so what kind of insights
what kind of insights have you gotten
like about yourself like have you been
like oh [ __ ] okay
uh this i do really well or this people
aren't reacting to as much as i thought
they would like what kind of things have
you been seeing
um
man i'm in i'm i'm at the crib bro i'm
home
yeah hell yeah and the [ __ ]
and the [ __ ] cleaned up the
whole crib i was like man
they got people to do this but they just
cleaned up like spit
spotless they left that [ __ ] like she
gonna be impressed when she walk in
there
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah me
hey look i'm doing this uh interview so
i'll hit you back in a minute
oh fire yeah
no just um
i just see that i wanted to see if
people would be biased to like
he's saying certain things say a bunch
of
things in that la liquor [ __ ] they're
like
infectious and i i wanted to see like
with would people have a bias to certain
parts of the information but
you know i've watched white people do
reviews i've watched
asian people do reviews i've seen black
guys do reviews
everybody was pretty much equally
um inspired yeah at the same
variations of content it wasn't like oh
the black dude like when i said
this and white guy like when i said this
an
asian guy like this it was like
everybody received it
equally and i thought that was dope
because it showed no bias
everybody was just like yo no that's
real [ __ ] i seen white guys when i'm
talking about slavery
and how slaveholders did this i've seen
white guys like no no
that's real [ __ ] and i'm like you know
what that's dope because for a long time
that's been such a sensitive area with
non-racist white people they've been
very sensitive to talk about you know
slavery because they don't feel in their
hearts so they don't even like to be
connected to any idea of it you know
yeah but i got you but but for us to be
able to have a conversation about
something
that just opens up a world of
understanding
being able to one another and you know
and i knew when i said it
it was i knew it would be like that you
know but
i'm like everybody knows me i'm not i'm
not a racist person or anything
but i have to say certain things that
represent my culture and about where i'm
from and what i've learned and
i want to share those things and they're
not always most beautiful things
but it's the truth you just spit the
truth there it was nothing there was
nothing like
i don't even think there was anything
political or whatever about it if you
want to make it about it then you're not
seeing what the real issue is which is
what you were talking about like it was
absolutely true
yeah yeah so it was dope to see people
receive it
not you know not make it like it's
cancerous you know
i just thought that was dope you know
yeah so
that was just cool fire no that's pretty
game from just watching reviews and
people like people watch me for the
first time i thought that was dope too
wait what where'd my man go
harry mack is in the room too uh in the

while there's platforms
to promote it you know when i was like
that [ __ ] bro it was like
had to be there you know right you had
to be
and if you missed it and everybody was
talking about it the day after
yeah you were like oh my god what
you get to you know you have you have a
platform and multiple platforms
to show your talent and you're taking
advantage of it just like i told iconic
like
these moments are happening because
there's people who believe in themselves
and they have perseverance and tenacity
to stick with it
and so these moments are developing
because of your hard work and dedication
you know so people are surprised
i'm here and i'm like you know i'm just
like no bro when you work hard

something on the
screenshot of the facetime everybody in

i gotta hop and start setting up for
this this stream real quick
but um are you about to do those bars
there's those
that thing you do the series yeah yeah
yeah we're about to do the uh now we're
doing the
um just a live stream i'm flowing on
dilla beats for for you know reading off
the comments
i'm glad you're feeding the people bro
you know i think a lot of times when
when cats do stuff they get stuck in
their old ways and and they
they don't give enough credence to the
younger people coming up that's carrying
a torch bro
it's important to carry the torch you
know a lot of
gatekeepers they don't pass like just me
saying yo
harry max the king you know that gives
so much reverence to you and there's
something about that energy that opens
up
a force that allows people not only to
respect you
but to the energy into the to the to the
forces to be with you you know
people don't people don't do that enough
you know everybody wants to be selfish
and be like well
you know you got dudes who was doing
this 30 30 years ago
and they want to hold on to it it's like
no let this this young guy has more
ambition than all of us
let let him let him take it and go he's
going outside he's on discord he's on
you know his live stream he's on ig he's
on twitter
man let that run rumble young man rumble
yo lois i can't even tell you with my
words man how much that means to me
like seriously to hear you say that like
it just lifts me up so much and
it's so meaningful to me personally um i
can't even tell you bro so thank you
seriously real true power
is the ability to empower others
that's where real power is bro it ain't
no power
me just wanting to run off and and be
revered as the best like
yo people give me so much love bro
people call me the [ __ ] goat like
that means a lot you know been being
said for like the last 10 years
fight i really that's it bro like i
don't take so i know if i've affected
somebody
and now they've it you know the first
day i met lil wayne
the first day i met little damn the
first
i meant him right i told mcmahon to
introduce me to him because
i just performed at the revolt um summit
in miami
and i looked over my shoulder and little
wayne is
in the in the cut rolling a blunt
damn and i'm like oh [ __ ] that's lil
wayne
right so i said yo mac mane
another mac another fellow mac yes yes i
said yo mac main
like introduce me to one you know i'm
like
right oh you you don't know wayne you
and wayne never i said
introduce me like i was like hurry up
before the moment's gone like introduce
me to wayne
right so he walks me over to wayne and
wayne is rolling the blunt wayne be in
his own world
wayne's world he just that's right
he knows nothing about this earth that
we that we dwell on he is
another dimension so he's rolling the
blunt
and he looks up and match like yo yo
wayne um
this is king lose so he like yo what's
up what's up so
i shake his hand and um he's like yeah
yeah what's up nice to meet you
and he kind of goes back to just rolling
his blunt right right
i'm like how the [ __ ] do i take
advantage of this
i feel like there's like three seconds
of a window
right something and it's closing fast
because wayne is just
disinterested with earth he's just
somewhere in the world
so i'm like i say yo wayne um
i don't like none of these rappers
yes so he looked what he's like
so i looked him square in the eye and i
was like yeah bro um
none of them but i [ __ ] with you
oh yeah and then i walked and i walked
away right
yeah that night so that was
maybe around 10 o'clock right 10 o'clock
at night that morning at
5 00 a.m yeah my phone rings and it's
mac main
right yeah and he's yo weezy wants you
to come to the studio
wow i'm like what
he's like yeah he's i don't know
whatever you said to him but
he's like man tell that dude to come
through wow
well i'm like bro so i'm like wow
so i thought about it i'm in miami right
i'm by myself
it's five in the morning i'm like i hope
wayne isn't in there with all the other
rappers and he's about to jump me
like you said i don't like none of the
rappers and
as scientist his art is like i don't you
know i'm just i'm just
and um yeah um i get to the studio
and it's just when wow in an engineer
and he's like that what you were to work
on
oh bro and i looked at this dude and i'm
like
you're not serious like we're we're
gonna do a song he's like whatever you
want to work on like what
what have you been working on what type
of [ __ ] you want to do and i'm like
duh whatever the [ __ ] you want to do
like whatever you want to do
so so we did a retro
he went in he went he picked the beat he
knew exactly what the beat was he told
the engineer it was some alien he's like
uh
go to some side folder b20 uh a
and i was like what and he pulled up the
beat the beat was fired
yeah he was like you like i was like
dude it's fire so
he went walked straight in the pool he
rolled in the blunt walk straight up
booth
spit his burst then i'm like
you gonna put that type of pressure on
me breath so
i walk right in behind him so he's like
oh [ __ ] you don't need to write
i walk right in behind remember we're
gonna spit my verse
of course i walk out when i'm spitting
my verse i'm looking out the window
because it's like all glass
and he's like like he's going crazy
and i'm like the moment i always wanted
and um
you know uh when he went back and he did
the third verse
he used part of what i said in my second
verse and that
right here i was like that's dope
so because it created the camaraderie
you know and and
so that's what i'm saying about somebody
as esoteric as a little wayne is to hip
hop
right meeting me and in one day not
being a gatekeeper
being a gate a door opener instead of a
gatekeeper you know what
invite that we didn't exchange numbers
nothing no
like that dude to the studio i'm gonna
do a record with him
because he recognized somewhere in my
efforts and my hard work
yeah my first time ever being recognized
on the internet was rapping on a milli
yeah wow it
full circle bro and it and it paid off
that was my
probably my biggest payoff ever
being recognized worldwide for a milli
and then
going on tour wrapping my emily rap on
tour
right to the freestyle is crazy and
then meeting little wayne in one day
doing a record with
after 15 years of giving him praise and
honor for being
one of the dopest you know meeting him
in it like that was
uncanny for me so i say that to say when
you see the harry max
um you know um and you know
people putting it down as somebody
opposition
you got to show that love you got to
extend that hand you got to open up
all the all your resources to them so
they can come up the same way
and be received the same way you know i
just feel like
it's a part of the culture that's kind
of missing everybody gets really
exclusive
and if little wayne could meet me and
then one day include me
in his mega mega world yeah you know
and not just want to do something with
somebody more notable
right i just i really respect that so
i'm i'm
beautiful it's so critical man it's so
beautiful dude like i
i i'm i'm [ __ ] i'm goose bumped up
right now i'm not gonna lie man and i'm
about to take this energy right now and
run with it
but um craziest live stream ever
hey i'm not it's gonna be insane dude i
don't even know it can't go any higher
than this
but look lois you're the [ __ ] goat
man um send me that beat let's keep
talking let's keep building i'm i'm so
excited to get down on some [ __ ] man
and uh yeah i got bro i'm gonna help you
all right let's go let's go love peace
oh [ __ ] i don't even know what to do
after that that was wild
that was dope extremely dope man hey
really appreciate you homie all right
unreal bro with his with his with his
abilities dude is unreal he's super
focused bro he
he deserves it oh a hundred percent
you're not working
and look at you bro you got you have to
be like
you're the only one who had you're the
first person in history
of youtube that has that moment
i know man it's still sinking in you
know it's it's still singing and that
was crazy
what's your name it's khan no
your name like the iconic iconic
look at that you're speaking it into
existence you gotta do it man you gotta
you gotta put in the work you gotta
um just make it happen honestly people
people are people are way too into
like complaining or finding out reasons
why it's not working
and like thinking about [ __ ] too much
instead of just going out and doing it
for
years before anything real happens and
then things slowly start to happen
and this is crazy that this is actually
happening man
um so really appreciate it um
amen i mean i'll talk to you more if
you're just chilling
like i got a couple questions if you
want to answer them
yeah so you were talking about the word
algorithms and language algorithms and
that's something that i've been thinking
about like a lot
uh lately just like trying to improve
what i'm doing and stuff um
and i i got like you know some of my own
thoughts but i just want to
give it to you about like how your you
take
words and make language work in
different ways and how much the flow
is coming from the music and the word
structures coming from the music like
there's a lot of ways you can go i'm
just curious what you meant by um that
when you were talking to harry
um say it one more time where i was
sending a text no
all good the the world the word
algorithms that you were mentioning
while you were talking to
harry how how like language works like
what what do you specifically mean by
that because that's something i think a
lot about because a lot of like the
music
inspires the flows and the words come
from the flows a lot of the time so like
how much does it connect to just the
language and how much does it connect
with the music
um the language
can be manipulated
um
the music however can't you can't
manipulate
the music uh music is
the absolute truth the words
can be lies the flow can be manipulated
it can be bent and
untwisted um but you
it can never go against the music right
the minute you do a flow
it doesn't match this the symmetry of
the music
then you're off beat it's off yeah it's
off 100 but words
you can do anything with you can
manipulate words you can bend words
you can you can make up words you know
so
um just that the algorithm of how that
works
is basically it's basically like it's
very matrixy
um it's a very like computer um
you know it's a very like simulated um
the brain is just reaching for yeah like
a program but the problem is
people
using thought
and it's at a slower
like bit rate if i could say yeah yeah
yes no i
i know exactly what i think about this a
lot homie
thoughts are at a slower bit rate
than than um
the truth of of of just allowing
or becoming a part of the flow no
thoughts are slower and that and that
and you got to think about it if
thoughts are slower because thoughts are
fast
if thoughts and thinking is slower than
the actuality of
becoming that truth it's very matrixy
it's it's the neo effect it's like
when neo was trying so hard to do it he
kept failing he couldn't jump he
couldn't 100
you know morpheus took him to the jump
you know the jump sequence or the jump
program
he kept falling it was when he knew
it was when he understood that he was
the flow that's when he could stop
bullets that's when he could
perform so you have people who are
thinking
and once you're thinking it jams up the
algorithm it jams up the
the bit rate it slows it down because
you're trying to think
which is an interference thinking is an
interference you're interfering
with the natural flow of life so what
you have to do is you have to become
a part of that flow and you have to
allow yourself to be used
to be used you know and um that's what
that's what um it's more about surrender
and less about control you know people
are like trying to control it
and it's like no you surrender to the
will of that beat because
that beat has a set
parameters and there's no way you can
move them and scoot them over
it's that's the way it is yeah now you
can go around it you can go between it
yeah
you can go over and under it and all
that but if you
bump into it you're over with you're
done hundred percent
hundred percent man you're preaching
right now this is
because i've been like okay the words
will come right the moment i start
thinking of the words the flow [ __ ] up
but the words will come as i do it more
and the words are building now like i'm
getting more and more words in each
rhyme scheme and
and the flow is always developing on top
of the beat
so you're just confirming a lot of like
what i've been thinking about the
freestyle
there's a technique to what you're doing
it's um it's called forcing it's not
it's not necessarily a bad thing because
it's like um
it's like calisthenic training yeah
well no no it's more like it's not like
calisthenic okay it's
more like um it's more like power
building
where you just go for power
and you're doing your because you're
forcing
throwing a lot of power because
what you're doing is you're putting
yourself in a scenario
where you're pushing yourself to fail
ultimately but
every time you're trying to develop more
and more until that failure happens
so eventually you push the failure as
far away as it can be
and you get more in each time which is
like power building
yes calisthenics work would be more in
the natural
you're doing more like like how bruce
lee
was using electromagnetic
like yeah stimulate that [ __ ]
tires your whole body out right but it's
like it zaps you
so like what you're doing is
that this leads you to become really
funny
and it's called cringe factor and what
they do is they go on stage and they say
a joke that
absolutely should bomb yeah it should
fail
and it should make everybody mad and
then at the height
at the apex of when it should be just
the worst joke like it's a fail retreat
get out of there
it's their chance now to make it funny
there you go yeah so if they can
revive it and now turn it and flip it
and make it funny
from it being cringy that's how they
build that muscle of being able to deal
with
any crap the way you
are freestyling it's not very safe it's
um
it's like you're forcing yourself to
stay on this rhythm
to stay on this pattern and you're
trying to get the words and you're
trying hard things yeah see
to see average eye it may look like oh
he's stumbling he's [ __ ] no
he's trying hard [ __ ] he's trying
maltese
he's he's trying you know um compound
syllables and he's trying to fit it all
inside
of a pocket and make it make sense
that's not easy to do
not at all you know that's not easy to
do but you know i would also say
try some calisthenic work too where
you surrender to the flow
and don't force it to just surrender to
the flow
i got you i got you you'll find yourself
like because what you do there's this
one
switch up the patterns 100
i've seen you analyze this so i know you
know what it is yeah yeah no i got you
you feel you're getting to that tough
spot switch up the patterns
and add some charisma 100
yo i literally so this type of [ __ ]
mac literally said very similar you're
adding a lot of different stuff on it
but he said very similar [ __ ] so in the
morning not live
i do a lot and i'm trying to incorporate
this live more too
but i just kind of freestyle and do that
what you're what you're saying like
kind of make sure that it's making sense
and then also just surrender to the flow
and just
not try these crazy [ __ ] because the
trying itself means you're aware of what
you're doing which means you're thinking
which means you're not in the flow
so i i'm aware of that and i try to you
know
and each time each live does end up
getting better
but man everything you're saying like is
everything
watching you freestyle it was good and
you're fearless you're not afraid to
[ __ ] up that's the biggest
part can't be afraid to [ __ ] up
can't be afraid to stumble so that's
good
i got you well man i mean i don't want
to take too much of your
time this is like this is crazy i could
go on forever obviously
but i want to be respectful of your time
i don't know what you're doing it was
outside the garage
just probably love this morning what
what's happening
yo you going you getting it
i mean practice makes perfect bro i've
been
i've been practicing for years man i
understand
i used to just pray but you got to be
insane with your practice
you got to be insane with your practice
like that's another thing
you got to be like you know submerged in
it you gotta just be like
buried in it man
bro that's anything anything
you gotta be obsessed with if you're not
obsessive you're not gonna be able to
get to that next level like you need to
be obsessive and then like
with that right now it's freestyle it it
kind of ebbs and flows you got to be
obsessed about different [ __ ] and then
as you get older
it all kind of ties together like all
this meditative all the spiritual
all this stuff you're talking about
right now was another time frame in your
life that you built that knowledge and
skill set up and now it's combining with
the freestyling a lot you know
i don't yes i agree because that's the
same [ __ ] for me like i was
obsessed with soccer for a long ass time
i
um then basketball classic rock guitar
solos and
[ __ ] like that now freestyling and nba
um
but man this is crazy shout out to the
35 people in the room i know max live
man max always live so
i'm gonna go until my man lowe's dips um
and we're gonna chill and we'll we'll
definitely go
go to max live after this so shouts out
to zion visionary
steve robinson jacob johnson gonna
reshuffle the plastic right off those
cards
yo it's just my hands i always need
something for my hands to be doing
um would you show us my cards these are
just
these just randomly came in i didn't
even
i'm not sending them in for grading or
anything um
but i've got a bunch of different cards
got this jimmy butler i got these
lebrons chilling
um i'll do a sports cards thing one day
[Music]
look at my laptop
for sure yo so you got the streamer set
up are you gonna start doing that [ __ ]
regularly
let's see let's get in this house yeah
yeah yeah yeah
i'm gonna start um i'm gonna start doing
it
uh a lot more awkward for sure are you
are you gonna look into
both twitch and youtube or just stay
youtube
um i'll literally
i'll eventually get on to it eventually
yeah i'm just going to
stay where i'm at right now just so i
can focus yeah
but um yeah i've been uh i just i've
been working on i just been working on
projects bro i've been working on music
all freestyles i'm assuming do you write
do you write anything or are you always
off top like
how does that go for you well i'm always
uh i'm always within
it's not fun it's not always um
uh off the top but it's always within i
don't i don't write
yeah but i create from within
so i don't like have a pen and a pad and
i'm not
jotting [ __ ] down not i'm not writing in
my phone and reading something
yeah because i'm doing like songs where
i'm like singing
and [ __ ] too so i'm just going in there
and feeling it
and then i'm literally creating and
painting on the canvas
and just if it's abstract it's abstract
if it's
if it's classical as classical you know
i'm just yeah yeah
i'm just but i'm like
i'm doing that thing where i'm like i'm
obeying
the laws of sound and
respecting the sonics of the music
i'm just like existing with the music
and
i don't know display my art
what becoming one with that music
sonically and um
there's no way to write because then i'm
like
it's an interruption yeah to interfere
now if i want to be like if i i mean
i don't need to write but if i wanted to
be very
extremely technical i i could just write
but i'm not looking for that
i'm looking for that i'm not looking for
technique i'm looking for
connection 100 i feel that you're you're
looking for what's real in the moment
you're not looking for something
manufactured to come after the fact
yeah but i'm not looking for like praise
um
of of my skill i'm looking for to
actually connect
i'm looking to have a conversation you
know and i can do all that writing too
but i just want it to come from within
you know i feel that never man
there's something natural about
conversation
it's i mean the connection it's it's why
everyone gets into this
especially this year with covet and like
kind of being home and like
the connection has been you know limited
for a lot of people which makes
you lose it a little bit in your mind
but that's why the internet and
if you kind of find the connection
through other pathways
then you could get it and and live with
it um
and that's why all this [ __ ] is is
amazing like we got a bunch of people
watching here you just randomly hopped
on the stream after
seeing my reviews after watching
thousands of reviews and and we're just
doing this
and that's that's dope man i mean this
is
i didn't know you were honestly this so
what's surprising to me right now is how
wise you are homie like you are just
very like a visionary with what you're
thinking like
i swear oh thanks
like not that yeah
that's what i want that's what that's
what i want that's exactly what i want
people to recognize
yeah yeah man
oh [ __ ] let's go
no no no i was just uh trying to see
what this music was oh no
i mean if you got bars you're more than
welcome
now
[Music]
[Music]
is
[Music]
so
thank you
yo i can't hear you
that's just crazy hobie who i mean who
is is that you is that who who's that
oh god yes that's my uh my producer rj
yoho dude
you're about to rip that [ __ ] so hard
man i i just can't wait to hear what you
got at that man
that's something i was gonna do for um
for my album let's get it
maybe turn it down a little bit
[Music]
right there
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh my god
fire
[Music]
i don't know if i should take a verse or
just let it play
but the thing is what i be doing to the
way that i be moving it just appraise
suppress be the beat when i go invest
invest out the chest when the lyrics i
possess
i enter the zen and i never the beast
cutting out homie like i
i can't i can't i can't rap on it that's
the problem
[Music]
you lose the ability to interpret the
beat that's that's what was happening to
me
so like when i went to rap on harry
maxby i couldn't get a beat
you couldn't connect to it and if you
don't connect to it it's just like it's
you know it doesn't it doesn't come out
it feels like
you're spaceless once you once you can't
hear the beat
you don't know where you don't have no
guidance right a hundred percent hundred
percent
what to do right hundred percent without
the beat it's really tough it's
it's super tough i'll play something
from
my mixtape though if you have the link
we could play it on groovy and that'll
be a lot better
the the bot the bot in the channel
you got to get to they got to get the
distorted version now
just so just so it's like because it's
unreleased so it's like you know
you still got to keep it i got you i got
it you know how to be like
i know i'll be i got you over yeah you
ain't from
like bruh people will like play music
over the phone
like back in the day you'd be like bro i
cannot hear that [ __ ]
you're like like it's got to be you got
to do some old man [ __ ] right now and
just play it over
okay hold on let me see like for sure i
just wish like when i when i spoke i
wish it didn't uh cut out that's the
whole issue
let me see let me see s
won it um
oh yeah yeah you might have heard a
snippet of this before
i've been afraid to feel for too long
the first [ __ ] i felt in a while was too
strong instead of being afraid i've
handicapped love that's crippled needing
an
eight i'm literally in the way i'm about
to run away feel like the world against
me i'm hoping
[Music]
these life lessons
imagine if it ever
feel like the world against me i hope a
[ __ ]
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yo yo fire track homie that's a that's a
put on repeat and and you know
memorize that [ __ ] type and vibe too the
court like everything homie
five no double meanings and everything
in that first verse just
wild man i got i can't wait can't wait
for the
the real version to drop yeah so
yeah and then in the final that's not
even the final version but uh
let's go all right ironically it's gonna
sound so much better and then um
so that's like the so so like the
mixtape is kind of in that vibe
so you got a mixtape and an album coming
through both in the works
tape is all original so it isn't it's
still an album but it's
more for free it's more free
it's more free you know it's it's just
more it has more freedom in it as far as
like
you know it is it's like my album is to
it
is my album musically is bigger
yeah yeah yeah i got you i like that i
like that
my album is musically bigger so it'll
reach a bigger audience right
not losing any of my integrity it's it's
all still king lows
but the mix tape is like it's like a bmx
freestyle you know it's like
man i might get up there and i might do
some tony hawk [ __ ] you know that's the
mixtape
you know but the album is big
you know and then i got the the
valentine's day um album
that i'ma do
10 10 or 12 songs more so just like
for the ladies you know just without
appreciating women yeah yeah that's
that's fire man i this is this is dope
so much hit in the works and makes sense
man it makes sense i feel like
i was just waiting for that king loss is
going to start to do some shits
very soon and i was feeling that but
it's it's good to hear it happening soon
man
we got three projects all ready for 21.
let's get it
let's get it we pumped we're taking over
three projects
and i'm saying like when the album
like the album itself when the album
starts
is to give an idea of how big the
the sound is this is like how like the
intro
you know
you're
[Music]
let's go so you
you're like
say say that again homie uh you're
cutting off
still convert how that sound was
how that sound was coming in it was
immediately
like so much bolder i mean it just
sounded like something epic was about to
start
and and it's more captivating
it's bigger music instrumentation it's
it takes a lot it's a lot of work to put
that to that
track to put that together it's a lot of
work and then it's called free now
it's called free now and um it's big
it's like anthemic
you know so the album is really anthemic
it has a lot of anthems
a lot of still that king looks
motivational that same thing
um more melodic nature so it's like this
is
bigger is there a theme is there a theme
to the album uh
yeah the album is called save yourself
save yourself
and from that very similar to the to the
lyrics and the story that you
had in that first song you played in
full save yourself
fire fire yeah so um
it's that and then you got the the v-day
joint that is straight for the ladies
it's i mean it's for the dudes too but
it's dedicated to the women you know
it's just of course it we gotta
stay out here just being all all
beautiful and smelling good
and making us feel good like about maybe
about 90
of all this stuff we do we do for the
like of or the love of a woman
it's crazy when you actually think about
that [ __ ] 100
dressing nice working to become
something
so some woman thinks you're great you
know i mean
it's just like we do a lot but we got to
show that appreciation
so you know i want to that's why i'm
doing that [ __ ]
i love it i got some great great great
songs for that some grooves
hey you know you know i'm gonna do a to
the people who are still tuned into this
you know i'm doing some live
listenings to all these uh projects what
they drop 100 percent man i'm so pumped
to hear them
oh yeah bro yeah you're gonna you're
gonna you're gonna volume
it's a vibe bro like i said i'm
i'm really into the music and creating
so
as hard as i've ever focused on
freestyling and
doing all that type of stuff and being
recognized i'm focusing
just as hard now um on
the musical aspect of things you know
making the songs better
so the production is up to par you know
yeah
you know underground but trying to take
my message and my integrity to a more
mainstream
um concept i wouldn't say like trying to
be mainstream but just the mainstream
concept
of no i mean there is a difference there
is a difference between like a global
like i want everyone to hear this versus
like i want the hip-hop heads to hear it
it's it's a difference and and you can
clearly hear it
just by the intro to that album it's
like all right i want this to be like
audio like grand sounding right but also
i want to be able to perform it in like
arenas and stuff whenever that [ __ ]
happens like i it gives that vibe for
sure
um and it's it's different
although i'm writing a song
i would have someone um someone um
recording a song that i wrote oh for
sure
asking me about the about with the
lyrics on fire
well i'm gonna shout out the audience
then real quick let me
let me uh talk to y'all lord b says this
stream is something else
jonko saying uh there were like 15
people when lowe's first joined shout
out to the 25 people in here we were up
to like 50 60 at one point um
when everyone was chilling um steve
robinson khan you better
uh tell lois that we are [ __ ] with
them so everyone everyone loves you in
the in the comments homie
uh um
let's see let's see let's see
andrew littlefield coming in with the
fires shout outs to everyone in the room
man bear julian
let me know when you're ready i don't
know if you're still uh doing your song
get your messaging or whatever also if
you have to dip just let please let me
know whenever
uh i'm taking up too much of your time
because i could i could go on for a long
ass time um so
don't you want to be respectful um of
your time as well
so which one which one are you
i don't know i guess they're all kind of
separate babies but like the the mixtape
and the
valentine's and the um album like are
they are they all kind of combined
together in this 21 like king loses
coming back type of type of vibe or like
what kind of
uh message are you trying to deliver you
know
yeah yeah yeah it's like
it's like a it's like a return yeah
not that you've been out it's but but
like you know like i feel like
it i haven't been like okay king lost is
doing a bunch of [ __ ] right now and i
feel like that's
2021 because he's just been underground
kind of building
um not on the ground but like you know
building up yeah yeah yeah
underground dude i've been because i
haven't been very
yeah i haven't been very i've been kind
of underground you know that's why the
teasers you know the teasers are all
like you know just popping up oh king

how can i not cap that off
with the freestyle i need to do one beat
of goodbye beat to the stream
what just happened i just broke a hole
in the matrix
bro i don't even know man i i have no
idea what's going on
uh we just had like an hour long
interview with the man himself
king lose harry mack joined it we talked
about some
dope [ __ ] um
[Music]

beat
a lot of people threw a beat let's see
let's see what's up i'm tripping
i'm tripping hold up let's actually see
what a-man's doing before or before we
get a
verse and amen are you here i need
someone to react with me on this

[ __ ] it a man you're my guy but we're
just gonna go
we're just gonna go
where's my how's my heart rate dude it
it calmed down it calmed down
uh but it was high as [ __ ] um and i
don't know how well i did on that verse
that i spent after
losing harry it just seemed like he was
kicking it off to me and i didn't want
to
you know lose my chance and on the beats
when they were playing i was like
i really want to spit right now but i
also
don't want to suppress the beat i want
to honor the beat
but we're good now ah
yup yup yes i know that we possessed
with the flows in the mind we need to
stop
thoughts in my mind and i know that i
just got spots of the little lions i
connect them the like dots are
what i'm doing yes and i'm flexing
texting you with the lessons possessed
in
the flow you know that you need
obsessions and then tie it together when
you get wisdom i've been them
with the flow now i've been on all the
flows and i know that i've been wrong
a lot of times but you know that i'm now
strong with the way that i flow when
they go
all night long all night long what going
through
my mind got songs in my mind cause the
boy gonna sing the most clever songs on
his new album king los is gonna come
through he just brings the most of the
heat and presults in the
wisdom and i spit some more for you see
what i do to the bee yes i tell you that
it's free off the dome and i be chilling

spray in to your brain and i'm gonna be
maintaining through the way yes you know

think about things you need to do
to get in rooms are the little people

demographics that you tactically go
tragically ah
that you're gonna go through you're
sustained to fly what i'm doing just to

the things to say and then take the flow
and then maybe ride the wave cause he
gonna say what he got to say in his mind
if you let the thoughts go then you'll
maybe
unwind to the flow and then maybe the
people will rewind but you don't really
care about the lines that they find and
they mine but the kind cause iconically
rhyme if i [ __ ] up i'll just move
through all the little lines in my head
and do
all the things so fine either way i
would spit into zero people on the line
