years now since it's been written
all right the beats about to drop let's
see what you got
yeah come on
[Music]
[Music]
when i think of the pen just get past
the guards like with rhyme design lines
just like it's keys baked in watch me
excel
keep feeling feelings in cells like
excel
in sales on mobile so i'm using the
phone to sell roaming from home
just to get out of the cell locked into
a bar at a bar
it's like drinking in hell my fable is
so bad so i'm grabbing the pad chill
with the dog so i can run with the cats
critical in your if you're a cat that's
not got my back my facts on the wax
[Music]
grab the battle axe splitting y'all in
half from the front to back
surgical let me recite surround i with
mc
and i turned it to mike for me
i replace i see with e sit down and
rewrite
now it's written and rewritten right
feeling ecstasy
smitten despite all the fight ideas grow
like bulbs i'm gliding like light
switching to flipping so don't flop on
the beat keep it low profile when i hit
the concrete
feel the feet on the street so let's
keep it short and brief like a brief
case it wasn't clear don't disbelieve
this disbelief
yo religious rhythm killing cadence from
my core down to the feet
it's like magical mystical beast
spitting fire and if you can't
didn't catch the bars the first time
pause rewind and
do it for me do it for me i just spew up
the freeze up the mind
yes i'm gonna spew up the heat that
you're gonna want yes you gonna knew it
was kind
everyday i'm gonna be losing with the
way i'm dreaming fine you know that i'm
gonna be seeming to be on a different
line and i know that that's fuel all the
time it's the flow through the wild
through the wildlife
vibes that die no and you're gonna get a
written
yes you're gonna know that i'm getting
all the scripture in my mind yes i'm
going to mess up
all the lyrics and i'm going to be
getting in the blessed things i'm going
to tell you
good the mic yo sorry let me
let me let me talk about the verse real
quick i just
went off on the freestyle boy no that
was killer though that
was killer kick bro you kill it man
bro you you don't realize how much you
kill it bro i don't think you realize
how much you kill it
bro sometimes i realize it but sometimes
i look back when i thought i realized it
and i was like it wasn't that you know
like because i'll watch it back and then
because i'll feel it during the
performance
or during the live yeah and all that and
i'll rerun it back and i'm just like oh
it actually wasn't that dope or whatever
and then
so i always you know need to stay humble
always need to stay out here no no keep
stop keep on your vibe rob you you're
killing it bro you're coming up
yo but yeah what did you think what do
you give me some critiques bro why do
you think that
yo honestly i think one i need to hear
it
on a normal beat too not a normal beat
but like the
the same beat but not delayed like on
that same beat
but not delayed because the flow is
slightly off on discord but regardless
the stuff you were doing with the mic i
i turn
i put the eye around mc and mike like
the where did where did my man go are
you here
he dipped one second
one second
yo my man oh bro i
i lost you there for a minute man so so
what i was saying is
one i would i need to hear it on like
you recording
it on the same beat basically but
yeah in the flow just because of the
slight lag in discord but regardless of
that
the the [ __ ] you were doing within the
bars were fire
it's just i need to hear it lined up on
the on the floor like the mic
i actually rid it on huh you need
to be you need to hear the beat that i
wrote it too exactly that that's that's
what i need to hear for the for the
cadence and the delivery aspect which i
think is like
very crucial um but yeah the the bars
were fired like the bars are fire
um throughout like the mic stuff and
then
i'm trying to recall bars but
i'm forgetting it back i'll give you
like it was it was very clever
no i appreciate that man i appreciate
that bro definitely man
if hey if you've got another little beat
i'll drop a little tiny freestyle here
quick and then obviously switch to
reverse on whatever man
i don't want to take up your flow man
